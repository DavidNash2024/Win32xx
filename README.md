<p dir="auto">Win32++ is an open-source C++ library designed to simplify 
	the development of Windows API-based applications. It provides a modern 
	C++ interface while staying lightweight and easy to use. Here are some key 
	features:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Modern C++ Interface: Win32++ leverages C++ features like classes, 
		inheritance, and templates to provide a more intuitive and modern way of 
		creating Windows applications.<br></li>
		<li>Lightweight: Unlike larger frameworks such as MFC or Qt, Win32++ is 
		designed to be lightweight and has minimal overhead. This makes it 
		suitable for smaller applications or for developers who prefer to stay 
		close to the Win32 API.<br></li>
		<li>Ease of Use: The library simplifies many 
		of the tasks associated with Win32 programming, such as creating 
		windows, handling messages, and managing resources. It is implemented as 
		a header-only library which simplifies the build process.<br></li>
		<li>Extensibility: Win32++ allows developers to easily extend its 
		functionality, making it adaptable to a wide range of application needs. 
		Its modular design allows developers to include as much or as little of 
		the library as they require.<br></li>
		<li>Open Source: It is freely available under an open-source license, 
		allowing developers to use and modify it as needed.</li>
	</ul>

<p dir="auto">Win32++ can be used to build applications based simple windows, 
dialogs, forms, and frames. The frames produced using Win32++ can have the following features.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
	<li>Multiple Document Interface (MDI) frames</li>
	<li>Single Document Interface (SDI) frames</li>
	<li>Owner drawn menubar, toolbar and statusbar</li>
	<li>Theming</li>
	<li>The Ribbon Framework</li>
	<li>Splitter windows</li>
	<li>Docking</li>
	<li>Support for dark mode</li>
	<li>Support for per-monitor DPI awareness, version 2</li>
