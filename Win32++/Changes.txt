Version 5.7
-----------
New Features
* Added CDC class. This class simplifies the drawing to device contexts. 
   - Automates the selection of GDI objects into the device context.
   - Automates the destruction of GDI objects.
   - Automates the deletion or release of the device context.
   
* Added an immediate mode to CSplitter. There is now the choice of resizing
   the panes while the splitter bar is being dragged, or defer the resizing
   until the splitter bar drag is complete (as before).
   
The following changes have been made to the Win32++ code:
Added CDC class 
Added CSplitter::SetImmediate
Added CSplitter::SetVertical
Added CWnd::GetDlgItemText
Added CWnd::GetWindowText

Changed CSplitter::CSplitter 	now requires no arguements



Version 5.61
-----------
New Features
* Added support for Visual Studio 2008 and Visual Studio 2008 Express
* Better exception handling:
  - Any failure of 'new' now generates a bad_alloc exception
  - Exceptions are thrown when rebar messages such as RB_INSERTBAND fail.

Bug Fixes:
* The size of text in dropdown menus is calculated more accurately.

Version 5.6
-----------
Bug Fixes:
* MDI accelerators (like Ctrl+F6) now work
* Fixed notification reflection in CDialog
* Browser sample now compiles with VS 2005 Express

New Features:
* Added InitInstance to CWinApp. Code to create windows should now be
   placed in InitInstance instead of the constructor of the CWinApp
   derived class. Doing this allows the CWinApp derrived class to be
   fully constructed before attempting to create windows. WinMain 
   (or _tWinMain for Unicode apps) has also changed. A typical _tWinMain 
   now looks like this:
    INT WINAPI _tWinMain(HINSTANCE hInstance, HINSTANCE, LPTSTR, int)
    {
      // Start Win32++
      CFrameApp theApp(hInstance);
   
      // Run the application
      return theApp.Run();  // <- This has changed
    }
* Property Sheets are now supported. The files PropertySheet.cpp and 
   PropertySheet.h have been added to Win32++. These files define
   the CPropertySheet and CPropertyPage classes. The Property sheet generic 
   demonstrates the following:
  - Modal property sheets.
  - Modeless property sheets.
  - Wizards.
* The owner drawing of menus has been moved from CMenubar to CFrame. This
   has the following advantages:
  - Frames without rebars have themed menus.
  - Other popup menus belonging to CFrame (or CMainFrame) are themed.
  - Functions which customise the appearance of the menus are now located
     in CFrame. They are easily overriden for a different visual effect.     
* The icons used in popup menu items can come from several bitmap resources.
  When an application has several toolbars in a rebar, for example, the icons 
  from each of these can be displayed in popup menus.
* Added a colored rectangle around checkmarks.
* Added TabDialogDemo sample.
* CWnd objects can now be static variables

Version 5.5
-----------
Bugs Fixed:

  as an undeclared identifier.
* Dev-C++ reports a warning passing NULL used for non-pointer
* Threads sample, can generate an exception in release mode
* Performance sample, m_nTestWindows not initialised
* Corrected text layout for toolbar buttons with TBSYLE_DROPDOWN style.

New Features:

  theme for the rebar, toolbar and menubar. To modify the theme, override
  SetTheme in CMainFrame. To disable themes, set m_bUseThemes to FALSE in
  CMainFrame::OnCreate.
* The default color of a splitter bar is set to the background color of 
  the rebar.  
* If a resource for disabled toolbar items isn't provided, an ImageList
   for disabled buttons is created for you. This imagelist is used for
   displaying disabled toobar buttons, and disabled menu items with an icon.
* Updated Rebar themes
  - Improved rendering of non-toolbar bands during band repositioning
  - Round borders and flat style now supported in Win95, Win98 & WinME

Version 5.4
-----------
Bug Fixes:
* Text for toolbar buttons wasn't always displayed on Win2000
* It is now safe to call CToolbar::SetImageist multiple times

New Features
* Added Rebar themes, including:
  - Gradient background for the rebar control (any two colors)
  - Gradient background for the rebar bands (any two colors)
  - The Menubar can be locked in place.
  - The bands can be kept left.
  - Short bands
  - Bands can have rounded borders
  - Bands with rounded borders can have a flat style
* Added Toolbar themes, including:

Added IsXPThemed
Changed CFrame::AddToolbarBand
Changed CRebar::ResizeBand
Changed Toolbar::GetItemRect
Removed CFrame::SetButtons
Removed CWinApp::SetAcceleratorTable


Version 5.3
-----------
New Features:
* Owner drawn drop down menu items with icons.  CMenubar::SetIcons is
   used to determine which menu items display an icon. By default, the
   framework uses the toolbar's bitmap and resource IDs for displaying 
   icons. Override CFrame::SetButtons to change this behavior.
* Automatic subclassing for windows using WinAPI defined window classes.
   Now when a window is based on predefined window classes, like the 
   common controls (e.g. list-view, tree-view, richedit), the window is
   automatically subclassed. There is now no need to call the subclass
   function in use code.

Changes:
* The WndProc function used to route window messages has been simplified. 
   WndProcDefault should now used to pass messages on for further
   processing, rather than Cxxx::WndProc. (The old method will still work)
* The DialogProc function used to route dialog messages has been simplified.
   DialogProcDefault should now be used to pass messages on for further
   processing, rather than Cxxx::DialogProc. (The old method will still work)
* Added automatic subclassing for all windows created from predefined 
   window class types. This includes, for example, windows created from
   common controls like toolbars and edit controls.
* Removed superclassing. Its redundant now.
* Enhanced CMenubar - Added icons to drop down menus. CMenubar::SetIcons
   determines which menu items display an icon. By default, this is called
   from CFrame::SetButtons.
* In OnNotify, removed the requirement to return the parent OnNotify 
    function. Return 0L for any unhandled notifications.
* In OnCommand, removed the requirement to return the parent OnCommand 
    function. Return FALSE for any unhandled commands.
* Added picture sample. This demonstrates how to display image files using 
   IPicture.    

Incompatibilities with previous versions
* The subclass function will generate a compile error if called directly. 
   Subclassing is automatic if required, so simply remove any call to the 
   Subclass function from user code.
* Superclass function is no longer available. Use automatic subclassing 
   instead.

Bug Fixes
* Fixed menu selection of MDI child windows
* Fixed painting of MDI child windows
* Fixed menu check marks for MDI frames
* Removed exception on exit for Win95
* Corrected desktop icon flicker when starting a frame application
* Drag and Drop now works in the Notepad sample

The following changes have been made to the Win32++ code:
Added CFrame::UpdateCheckMarks
Added CMenubar::SetIcons
Added CWnd::OnCommandFrame
Added CWnd::OnNotifyFrame
Added CWnd::WndProcDefault
Removed CWnd::Superclass
Renamed CMDIFrame::GetActiveChild to CMDIFrame::GetActiveMDIChild
Renamed CFrame::OnCommand to CFrame::OnCommandFrame
Renamed CFrame::OnNotify to CFrame::OnNotifyFrame
Renamed CFrame::WndProc to CFrame::WndProcDefault
Renamed CMDIFrame::WndProc to CMDIFrame::WndProcDefault
Renamed CMDIChild::WndProc to CMDIChild::WndProcDefault

Version 5.2
------------
Bug Fixes
* Fixed CWnd::Detach
* Removed possible deadlock in CWinApp::Trace
* Removed flicker when switching maximised MDI child windows.
* MDIChild windows now handle OnCreate and message reflection.
* Fixed a repainting bug in subclassed windows.

Incompatibilities with previous version
* OnCommand now takes WPARAM and LPARAM as function arguements. Use this:
  OnCommand(WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam)
  {
    switch (LOWORD(wParam))
    {
    case ID_xx:
      ...
      break;
    }
  }    

Changes:
* The Trace window is not displayed until a TRACE statement is encountered
   in debug mode.
* Added a seperate HINSTANCE for resources. This provides for multilingual
   support, when resources are loaded via a DLL.
* The thread a CWnd object runs in is now determined when its window is 
   created, rather than when the CWnd object is instantiated.
* Simplified updates to the statusbar. These are now done on a timer,
   instead of tracking mouse messages for the toolbar.
* Added the Internet Browser Sample. It demonstrates how to host an ActiveX
   control in a Win32++ window. It requires ATL.
* Added the Performance sample. This program now also conducts a simple 
   performance test to measure the efficiency of the message handling. 

   
The following changes have been made to the Win32++ code:
Added CFrame::OnTimer
Added CFrame::GetMenuItemPos
Added CFrame::SetFrameMenu
Added CRebar::IsBandVisible
Added CRebar::ShowBand
Added CWinApp::GetResourceHandle
Added CWinApp::SetAcceleratorTable
Added CWinApp::SetResourceHandle
Removed CFrame::ToolbarNotify
Changed CWnd::OnCommand  Now takes WPARAM LPARAM arguments


Version 5.1
-----------
New Features:
* Existing windows can be subclassed and converted to CWnd objects using Attach
* Dialog items can be sublcassed and converted to CWnd objects, using 
   AttachDlgItem.
* Improvements to CToolbar. The toolbar uses image lists which support using 
  separate bitmaps for normal, hot and disabled buttons. Text can be added
  to toolbar buttons, and the style can be set.
* Improvements to CStatusbar.  
* Notifications from common controls are reflected back to the CWnd object that
  generated them. 
* Messages from old style common controls are reflected back to the CWnd object
  that generated them.
  
Major Changes:
* Major updates to the CToolbar and CStatubar classes.
* Notification reflection.  WM_NOTIFY messages from child windows now call 
  OnNotifyReflect in the CWnd that generated them.
* Message reflection. Some controls send notifications to the parent window
  via specific messages such as WM_CTLCOLORSTATIC. These messages are reflected
  back to the CWnd object that generated them via OnMessageReflect.
* Existing windows (including dialog items) can now be attached to a CWnd.
  The window is automatically subclassed when attached to a CWnd.
* Integrated subclassing and superclassing into the framework. Superclassing 
  and subclassing is much simpler now.  Win32++ now keeps track of the 
  previous window procedure, and calls it automatically at the end of 
  CWnd::WndProc
* Toolbar notifies frame via ToolbarNotify when the mouse is over a toolbar 
  button.
* The keyboard indicators in the status bar are updated on a timer, rather than
  attempting catch keydown messages and notifications.
* Applications can now set a hot toolbar bitmap, and a disabled toolbar bitmap
  in addition to the standard toolbar bitmap for toolbar buttons.
* Non standard toolbar button sizes are now supported.
* Text on toolbar buttons is now supported.
* Setting of toolbar button styles is now supported.
* Simplified the setting of Toolbar resource IDs. They are now set in the 
  Mainframe's constructor by adding to a vector.
* There is now a clear separation between the Resource IDs defined by Win32++
  and those defined in the user's application. Resource IDs defined by Win32++
  are defined as IDW_XXXXXX, and range from 51 to 99. Users of Win32++ should
  begin their resource IDs from 100.
* The _WIN32_IE macro is now longer defined by Win32++. Users of Dev-C++ will 
  need to define this macro as a compiler option eg:  -D _WIN32_IE=0x0400  
  (or higher).

The following changes have been made to the Win32++ code:

CFrame::AddToolbarBand modified to CFrame::AddToolbarBand(int nHeight)
CToolbar::SetButtons modified to CToolbar::SetButtons(vector<UINT> ToolbarData)
CWnd::OnNotify modified, it now returns a LRESULT
CWnd::Superclass modified, now returns void

Bug Fixes
* CFrame::OnHelp now returns the focus back to the window that had it before 
  OnHelp was called.
* CSplitter:: Fixed drawing of splitter bar

Incompatibilities with previous version
* Resource IDs have changed, mandating changes to resource.h and resource.rc
* Toolbar resource IDs are defined differently, mandating a change to 
  CMainframe's constructor. 
* OnFrameCreated is removed, use OnInitialUpdate instead.
* CWnd::OnNotify now returns a LRESULT.
* The _WIN32_IE macro is now longer defined by Win32++. Users of Dev-C++ will 
  need to define this macro as a compiler option eg:  -D _WIN32_IE=0x0400 
  (or higher).

Version 5.0
-----------
This version provides for MDI frames and adds a rebar control and menubar to
frames. A CSplitter class is also included to allow a horizontal or vertical
splitter bar to divide a CWnd window.

Summary of changes
------------------
1) Moved the Win32++ files from ./Windows to ../Win32++. This allows any 
    number of Win32++ projects to share the same copy of Win32++ files.
2) Integrated the Basic and Enhanced frameworks into a single Win32++ framework
    If you were using the basic framework you will see the following changes:
   * Added rebars to the frame window
   * Added a menubar to the frame window
   * Added MDI frame support
   * Added splitter window support
3) The menubar (previously available in the enhanced version) now fully
    supports MDI applications.
4) Changed CSplitter. The splitter bar is now an additional child window rather
    than the CSplitter CWnd object itself.
5) CFrame::Recalclayout no longer invalidates the view window. Programmers can
    now choose whether or not to invalidate the view window when the frame
    window is resized. This has the potential to eliminate unnecessary flicker.
6) The namespace used by the framework has been renamed to Win32xx.

Changed the following classes
* Added   CCriticalSection         Used for thread synchronisation
* Added   CMDIApp                  Required for MDI applications
* Added   CMDIChild                Required for MDI applications
* Added   CMDIClient               Required for MDI applications
* Added   CMDIFrame                Required for MDI applications
* Added   CMenubar                 Provides a menubar for the frame
* Added   CRebar                   Provides a rebar for the frame
* Added   CSplitter                Provides a splitter bar for a CWnd
* Removed CWinClass                Use CWnd::RegisterClassEx instead

Changed the following functions
* Added   CFrame::IsMDIFrame       True if the frame is MDI
* Added   CFrame::IsMenubarUsed    True if the frame has a menubar
* Added   CFrame::IsRebarUsed      True of the frame has a rebar
* Added   CFrame::m_bUseMenubar    Set to TRUE if a Menubar is to be used
* Added   CFrame::m_bUseRebars     Set to TRUE if a Rebar is to be used
* Removed CWnd::Subclass           Use Superclass instead
* Added   CWnd::Superclass         Create a window class from an existing one.
* Added   CWnd::RegisterClassEx    Optionally register a window class
* Removed CWnd::MoveWindow         Not required, use ::MoveWindow instead.

Bug fixes: 
* Resolved thread safety problems.
* Resolved view window positioning issue in frames. 

Version 4
---------
1) Renamed the framework to Win32++

2) Changed the method of associating the Window's handle (HWND) and 
    the CWin pointer.  Previously SetWindowLong was used to store the 
    CWin pointer in the windows data area. Now std::map is used to 
    associate a CWin pointer with the HWND (i.e. the window's handle).
    
3) Added the lpParam parameter to both versions of the CWin::CreateEx
    function.  Users are now free to use lpParam for their own 
    purposes. This parameter defaults to NULL for backwards 
    compatibility.
    
Changed the following:
* Removed CResString               Use CWnd::LoadString instead
* Removed CTrace                   Use the TRACE command as before
* Renamed CWin to CWnd
* Added   CApp::GetFrame
* Added   CApp::SetFrame   
* Added   CFrame::GetFrameMenu        
* Added   CFrame::GetView            
* Added   CFrame::OnFrameCreated 
* Added   CFrame::OnHelp
* Added   CFrame::SetStatusText
* Added   CFrame::SetToolbarData
* Changed CFrame::SetView.        Now takes a reference to a CWnd object
* Removed CFrame::CreateEx        Removed both functions
* Removed CFrame::LoadToolbarData
* Added   CWin::GetHwnd	
* Added   CWnd::LoadString 
* Added   CWnd::OnInitialUpdate
* Added   CWin::PreCreate
* Added   CWnd::SubClass 
* Changed CWin::CreateEX       Added the lpParam parameter
* Changed CWnd::OnCreate       Now called when a WM_CREATE message is received.
* Removed CWnd::Show
* Removed CWnd::OnFocus
* Removed CWnd::OnClose
* Removed CWnd::operator const HWND().  Use CWnd::GetHwnd instead
* Added   DebugErrMsg
     
Version 3
---------
1) Added the CTrace class to provide tracing (in Debug 
    mode only). To use tracing, ensure that you are in Debug mode, 
    i.e. the variable _DEBUG is defined, and use the TRACE("xxxxx")
    function to send trace messages.  The first TRACE(...) creates 
    the CTrace object and the Trace Output Window.
    
2) Removed the reference counting of CWin objects from the CWin 
    constructor and destructor.
    
3) Added the following functions:    
    CApp::Lock            Enter a critical section
    CApp::Release         Leave a critical section
    CWin::DestroyWindow   Destroy the window associated with the CWin Object
    CWin::GetCWinObject   Gets the pointer for a CWin object (given its HWND)
    CWin::GetAncestor     Gets the root ancestor 
    CWin::OnCommand       For command messages
    CWin::OnNotify        For Notify messages

4) Enhanced the error reporting in the event of an exception. The 
    GetLastError information is now decoded and displayed if it 
    provides any additional information.
    
Version 2
---------
Key Changes:

1) Now uses TLS to store our "this" pointer during window creation,
    instead of a global variable. The code is now thread safe.

2) The code is now Unicode compliant.
    
3) Added debug mode. Exceptions produce a warning in a messagebox
    if _DEBUG is defined. 

4) Added CApp class to start Win32++.

5) Added CDialog class to support modal and modeless dialogs as well
    as indirect dialogs (dialogs created from a dialog template in
    memory).

6) The instance handle of the application is stored as a member variable
    of CApp. You can access this via the GetApp global function
    e.g. GetApp()->GetInstanceHandle()
    
7) Simplified window creation:
    The CWin::Create function has been added to provide a simple 
    method of creating a window with sensible defaults. Override this
    in your derived class to customise it further.
    Also, if the Window Class name is not provided, one is provided for
    you. The window class name provided is "Win32++ Window"
    
8) Changed the following functions:
* Added   CApp::GetInstanceHandle
* Added   CApp::MessageLoop
* Added   CFrame::Create
* Added   CFrame::SetView
* Added   CFrame::RecalcLayout
* Added   CStatusBar::Create
* Added   CToolBar::Create
* Added   CWin::Create	
* Added   CWin::MoveWindow	
* Added   CWin::GetCwinObject	
* Changed CWin::CreateEx		removed hInstance parameter
* Added   CWinClass::GetWndClassEx
* Added   CWinClass::SetWndClassEx
* Added   GetApp 			Added global function
