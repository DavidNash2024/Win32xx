Version 5.1
-----------
Major Changes:
* Major updates to the CToolbar and CStatubar classes.
* Notification Reflection.  WM_NOTIFY messages from child windows now call 
  OnNotifyReflect in the CWnd that generated them.
* Existing windows (including dialog items) can now be attached to a CWnd.
  The window is automatically subclassed when attached to a CWnd.
* Integrated subclassing and superclassing into the framwork. Superclassing and
  subclassing is much simpler now.  Win32++ now keeps track of the previous
  window procedure, and calls it automatically at the end of CWnd::WndProc
* Toolbar notifies frame via ToolbarNotify when the mouse is over a toolbar 
  button.
* The keyboard indicators in the status bar are updated on a timer, rather than
  attempting catch keydown messages and notifications.
* Applications can now set a hot toolbar bitmap, and a disabled toolbar bitmap
  in addition to the standard toolbar bitmap for toolbar buttons.
* Non standard toolbar button sizes are now suported.
* Text on toolbar buttons is now supported.
* Simplified the setting of Toolbar resource IDs. They are now set in the 
  Mainframe's constructor by adding to a vector.
* There is now a clear seperation between the Resource IDs defined by Win32++
  and those defined in the user's application. Resource IDs defined by Win32++
  are defined as IDW_XXXXXX, and begin from 0xE800. This is intended to avoid 
  clashes with user defined resource IDs.

CWnd::OnNotify modified, it now returns a LRESULT

Bug Fixes
* CFrame::OnHelp now returns the focus back to the window that had it before 
  OnHelp was called.
* CSplitter:: Fixed drawing of splitter bar

Incompatibilites with previous version
* Resource IDs have changed, mandating changes to resource.h and resource.rc
* Toolbar resource IDs are defined differently, mandating a change to 
  CMainframe's constructor. 
* OnFrameCreated is removed, use OnInitialUpdate instead.

Version 5.0
-----------
This version provides for MDI frames and adds a rebar control and menubar to
frames. A CSplitter class is also included to allow a horizontal or vertical
splitter bar to a CWnd object.

Summary of changes
------------------
1) Moved the Win32++ files from ./Windows to ../Win32++. This allows any 
    number of Win32++ projects to share the same copy of Win32++ files.
2) Integrated the Basic and Enhanced frameworks into a single Win32++ framework
    If you were using the basic framework you will see the following changes:
   * Added rebars to the frame window
   * Added a menubar to the frame window
   * Added MDI frame support
   * Added splitter window support
3) The menubar (previously available in the enhanced version) now fully
    suports MDI applications.
4) Changed CSplitter. The splitter bar is now an additional child window rather
    than the CSplitter CWnd object itself.
5) CFrame::Recalclayout no longer invalidates the view window. Programmers can
    now choose whether or not to invalidate the view window when the frame
    window is resized. This has the potential to eliminate unnecessary flicker.
6) The namespace used by the framework has been renamed to Win32xx.
7) Superclassing is now used instead of subclassing for common controls.

Changed the following classes
* Added   CCriticalSection         Used for thread synchronisation
* Added   CMDIApp                  Required for MDI applications
* Added   CMDIChild                Required for MDI applications
* Added   CMDIClient               Required for MDI applications
* Added   CMDIFrame                Required for MDI applications
* Added   CMenubar                 Provides a menubar for the frame
* Added   CRebar                   Provides a rebar for the frame
* Added   CSplitter                Provides a splitter bar for a CWnd
* Removed CWinClass                Use CWnd::RegisterClassEx instead

Changed the following functions
* Added   CFrame::IsMDIFrame       True if the frame is MDI
* Added   CFrame::IsMenubarUsed    True if the frame has a menubar
* Added   CFrame::IsRebarUsed      True of the frame has a rebar
* Added   CFrame::m_bUseMenubar    Set to TRUE if a Menubar is to be used
* Added   CFrame::m_bUseRebars     Set to TRUE if a Rebar is to be used
* Removed CWnd::Subclass           Use Superclass instead
* Added   CWnd::Superclass         Create a new window class from an existing one.
* Added   CWnd::RegisterClassEx    Optionally register a window class
* Removed CWnd::MoveWindow         Not required, use ::MoveWindow instead.

Bug fixes: 
* Resolved thread safty problems.
* Resolved view window positioning issue in frames. 

Version 4
---------
1) Renamed the framework to Win32++

2) Changed the method of associating the Window's handle (HWND) and 
    the CWin pointer.  Previously SetWindowLong was used to store the 
    CWin pointer in the windows data area. Now std::map is used to 
    associate a CWin pointer with the HWND (i.e. the window's handle).
    
3) Added the lpParam parameter to both versions of the CWin::CreateEx
    function.  Users are now free to use lpParam for their own 
    purposes. This parameter defaults to NULL for backwards 
    compatibility.
    
Changed the following:
* Removed CResString               Use CWnd::LoadString instead
* Removed CTrace                   Use the TRACE command as before
* Renamed CWin to CWnd
* Added   CApp::GetFrame
* Added   CApp::SetFrame   
* Added   CFrame::GetFrameMenu        
* Added   CFrame::GetView            
* Added   CFrame::OnFrameCreated 
* Added   CFrame::OnHelp
* Added   CFrame::SetStatusText
* Added   CFrame::SetToolbarData
* Changed CFrame::SetView.        Now takes a reference to a CWnd object
* Removed CFrame::CreateEx        Removed both functions
* Removed CFrame::LoadToolbarData
* Added   CWin::GetHwnd	
* Added   CWnd::LoadString 
* Added   CWnd::OnInitialUpdate
* Added   CWin::PreCreate
* Added   CWnd::SubClass 
* Changed CWin::CreateEX       Added the lpParam paramater
* Changed CWnd::OnCreate       Now called when a WM_CREATE message is received.
* Removed CWnd::Show
* Removed CWnd::OnFocus
* Removed CWnd::OnClose
* Removed CWnd::operator const HWND().  Use CWnd::GetHwnd instead
* Added   DebugErrMsg
     
Version 3
---------
1) Added the CTrace class to provide tracing (in Debug 
    mode only). To use tracing, enure that you are in Debug mode, 
    i.e. the variable _DEBUG is defined, and use the TRACE("xxxxx")
    function to send trace messages.  The first TRACE(...) creates 
    the CTrace object and the Trace Output Window.
    
2) Removed the reference counting of CWin objects from the CWin 
    constructor and destructor.
    
3) Added the following functions:    
    CApp::Lock            Enter a critical section
    CApp::Release         Leave a critical section
    CWin::DestroyWindow   Destroy the window associated with the CWin Object
    CWin::GetCWinObject   Gets the pointer for a CWin object (given its HWND)
    CWin::GetAncestor     Gets the root ancestor 
    CWin::OnCommand       For command messages
    CWin::OnNotify        For Notify messages

4) Enhanced the error reporting in the event of an exception. The 
    GetLastError information is now decoded and displayed if it 
    provides any additional information.
    
Version 2
---------
Key Changes:

1) Now uses TLS to store our "this" pointer during window creation,
    instead of a global variable. The code is now thread safe.

2) The code is now Unicode compliant.
    
3) Added debug mode. Exceptions produce a warning in a messagebox
    if _DEBUG is defined. 

4) Added CApp class to start Win32++.

5) Added CDialog class to support modal and modeless dialogs as well
    as indirect dialogs(dialogs created from a dialog template in
    memory).

6) The instance handle of the application is stored as a member variable
    of CApp. You can access this via the GetApp global function
    e.g. GetApp()->GetInstanceHandle()
    
7) Simplified window creation:
    The CWin::Create function has been added to provide a simple 
    method of creating a window with sensible defualts. Override this
    in your derrived class to customise it further.
    Also, if the Window Class name is not provided, one is provided for
    you. The window class name provided is "Win32++ Window"
    
8) Changed the following functions:
* Added   CApp::GetInstanceHandle
* Added   CApp::MessageLoop
* Added   CFrame::Create
* Added   CFrame::SetView
* Added   CFrame::RecalcLayout
* Added   CStatusBar::Create
* Added   CToolBar::Create
* Added   CWin::Create	
* Added   CWin::MoveWindow	
* Added   CWin::GetCwinObject	
* Changed CWin::CreateEx		removed hInstance parameter
* Added   CWinClass::GetWndClassEx
* Added   CWinClass::SetWndClassEx
* Added   GetApp 			Added global function
