Version 6.0
===========

New Features
------------
* Win32++ now also directly supports the Windows CE operating systems. 
   Windows CE is the operating system used on such things as Pocket PCs, 
   embeded systems and SmartPhones. 
  
* Added a CDC class. This class simplifies the drawing to device contexts. 
   This class can be used anywhere we would normally use a handle to a 
   device context (HDC). Its features include:
   - Automates the selection of GDI objects into the device context.
   - Automates the destruction of GDI objects.
   - Automates the deletion or release of the device contexts.
   
* PreRegisterClass can now be used to set the WNDCLASS parameters prior
   to registering the window class (which occurs automatically when created 
   by CWnd::Create). This provides a convenient way to set a window's 
   background brush or cursor.
   
* Improvements to tracing. Tracing now utilises the debug output pane, 
   provided by the various compiler IDEs instead of a separate window.
   It now uses OutputDebugString instead of a separate, so it is also
   compatible with debuggers.
   
* Added an immediate mode to CSplitter. There is now the choice of resizing
   the panes while the splitter bar is being dragged, or defer the resizing
   until the splitter bar drag is complete (as before).
   
* Automatically detects the XP theme used (Default, Silver or Olive), and
   adjusts the theme colors accordingly.
   
* Added project files for Borland's Turbo C++ 2006.

* Enhanced the tutorial. It now also demonstrates file operations and printing.

  
Other Changes:
--------------
* Changed CSplitter. Its constructor now requires no arguements.

* Changed the way windows are created. We no longer use a CBT hook as part of 
   the window creation process. It was this change which allowed Win32++ to
   directly support Windows CE.

Incompatibilities with previous versions:
-----------------------------------------
* CSplitter now uses a default constructor. This simplifies the use of 
  CSplitter. The following functions can be used to set the CSplitter 
  paramerters:
 - SetBarPos	sets the initial splitter bar position (default is 10)
 - SetBarColor   sets the color of the splitter bar (default is rebar color)
 - SetImmediate  sets immediate mode true or false (default is false)
 - SetVertical   sets vertical bar mode true or false (default is true)
 - SetWidth      sets the width of the splitter bar (default is 5)
 
 * Frame applications use the CDC class, so GDI.cpp will need to be added
   to existing projects.


Version 5.6
===========
* Added InitInstance to CWinApp. Code to create windows should now be
   placed in InitInstance instead of the constructor of the CWinApp
   derived class. Doing this allows the CWinApp derrived class to be
   fully constructed before attempting to create windows. 
* Property Sheets are now supported. The files PropertySheet.cpp and 
   PropertySheet.h have been added to Win32++. These files define
   the CPropertySheet and CPropertyPage classes. The Property sheet generic 
   demonstrates the following:
  - Modal property sheets.
  - Modeless property sheets.
  - Wizards.
* The owner drawing of menus has been moved from CMenubar to CFrame. This
   has the following advantages:
  - Frames without rebars have themed menus.
  - Other popup menus belonging to CFrame (or CMainFrame) are themed.
  - Functions which customise the appearance of the menus are now located
     in CFrame. They are easily overriden for a different visual effect.     
* The icons used in popup menu items can come from several bitmap resources.
  When an application has several toolbars in a rebar, for example, the icons 
  from each of these can be displayed in popup menus.
* Added a colored rectangle around checkmarks.


Version 5.5
===========
* If a resource for disabled toolbar items isn't provided, an ImageList
   for disabled buttons is created for you. This imagelist is used for
   displaying disabled toobar buttons, and disabled menu items with an icon.
* Updated Rebar themes
  - Improved rendering of non-toolbar bands during band repositioning
  - Round borders and flat style now supported in Win95, Win98 & WinME
* Updated Toolbar themes
  - Improved layout of images and text on toolbar buttons
  - Themed toolbar now supports TBSTYLE_LIST
* Added XP theme support for Visual Studio 6
* Icons for disabled popup menu items are now greyed
* Added Menubar theme support
  - Gradient background for hot buttons (any two colors)
  - Gradient background for pressed buttons (any two colors)
  - Gradient Sidebar for menu items based on pressed button colors.
  - A border color for Menubar buttons and selected menu items


Version 5.4
===========
* Added Rebar themes, including:
  - Gradient background for the rebar control (any two colors)
  - Gradient background for the rebar bands (any two colors)
  - The Menubar can be locked in place.
  - The bands can be kept left.
  - Short bands
  - Bands can have rounded borders
  - Bands with rounded borders can have a flat style
* Added Toolbar themes, including:
  - Gradient background for hot buttons (any two colors)
  - Gradient background for pressed buttons (any two colors)
  - Colored outline for hot and pressed buttons (any color)
* Built in support for multiple toolbars (in rebars) with AddToolbarBand
* Added Forms Sample
* Added Themes Sample


Version 5.3
===========
* Owner drawn drop down menu items with icons.  CMenubar::SetIcons is
   used to determine which menu items display an icon. By default, the
   framework uses the toolbar's bitmap and resource IDs for displaying 
   icons. Override CFrame::SetButtons to change this behavior.
* Automatic subclassing for windows using WinAPI defined window classes.
   Now when a window is based on predefined window classes, like the 
   common controls (e.g. list-view, tree-view, richedit), the window is
   automatically subclassed. There is now no need to call the subclass
   function in use code.   


Version 5.2
===========
* Added a seperate HINSTANCE for resources. This provides for multilingual
   support, when resources are loaded via a DLL.
* The thread a CWnd object runs in is now determined when its window is 
   created, rather than when the CWnd object is instantiated.
* Added the Internet Browser Sample. It demonstrates how to host an ActiveX
   control in a Win32++ window. It requires ATL.
* Added the Performance sample. This program now also conducts a simple 
   performance test to measure the efficiency of the message handling. 

   
Version 5.1
===========
* Existing windows can be subclassed and converted to CWnd objects using Attach
* Dialog items can be sublcassed and converted to CWnd objects, using 
   AttachDlgItem.
* Improvements to CToolbar. The toolbar uses image lists which support using 
  separate bitmaps for normal, hot and disabled buttons. Text can be added
  to toolbar buttons, and the style can be set.
* Improvements to CStatusbar.  
* Notifications from common controls are reflected back to the CWnd object that
  generated them. 
* Messages from old style common controls are reflected back to the CWnd object
  that generated them.
  

Version 5.0
===========
* Added rebars to the frame window
* Added a menubar to the frame window
* Added MDI frame support
* Added splitter window support


Version 4
=========
* Changed the method of associating the Window's handle (HWND) and 
   the CWnd pointer.  Previously SetWindowLong was used to store the 
   CWin pointer in the windows data area. Now std::map is used to 
   associate a CWnd pointer with the HWND (i.e. the window's handle).   
* Added the lpParam parameter to both versions of the CWnd::CreateEx
   function.  Users are now free to use lpParam for their own 
   purposes. This parameter defaults to NULL for backwards 
   compatibility.
        

Version 3
=========
* Added Tracing. To use tracing, ensure that you are in Debug mode, 
   i.e. the variable _DEBUG is defined, and use the TRACE("xxxxx")
   function to send trace messages.  The first TRACE(...) creates 
   the Trace output window.   
* Enhanced the error reporting in the event of an exception. The 
   GetLastError information is now decoded and displayed if it 
   provides any additional information.
* Added support for multi-threaded applications.    
    

Version 2
=========
* Now uses TLS to store our "this" pointer during window creation,
   instead of a global variable for thread safety.
* The code is now Unicode compliant.
* Added debug mode. Exceptions produce a warning in a messagebox
   if _DEBUG is defined. 
* Added CWinApp class to start Win32++.
* Added CDialog class to support modal and modeless dialogs as well
   as indirect dialogs (dialogs created from a dialog template in
   memory).
* The instance handle of the application is stored as a member variable
   of CWinApp. You can access this via the GetApp global function
   e.g. GetApp()->GetInstanceHandle()
* Simplified window creation:
   The Create function has been added to provide a simple 
   method of creating a window with sensible defaults. Override this
   in your derived class to customise it further.
   Also, if the Window Class name is not provided, one is provided for
   you. The window class name provided is "Win32++ Window"
