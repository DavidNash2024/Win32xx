About the Win32++ files
=======================
The "include" folder contains the files that would be included in a Win32++ 
project. In this folder, the Win32++ library files are provided purely as a 
set of header files. There are no source files, as all the source code is 
included inlined in the header files. This makes Win32++ simpler to use, as
we simply need to include header files to add the library to our projects.
