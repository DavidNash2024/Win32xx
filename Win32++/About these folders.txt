About the Win32++ files
=======================
The Win32++ library is now available in two flavours - one for typical use, 
and one for static libraries.  

The "include" folder contains the files that would be included in a typical 
project. In this folder, the Win32++ library files are provided purely as a 
set of header files. There are no source files, as all the source code is 
included inlined in the header files. This makes Win32++ simpler to use, as
we simply need to include header files to add the library to our projects. 

The "src" folder contains the Win32++ library files suitable for creating a
static library. This folder contains both source files and header files. The
header files in this folder are smaller, as they do not include the inlined
code. More experienced programmers might prefer using Win32++ as a static 
library as it allows projects to be compiled more quickly.

Apart from the differences mentioned above, the two libraries are identical
in the officially released versions. Users of the "work in progress" code
available via Tortoise SVN should note that the static library code is updated
less frequently than the code in the "include" folder.
