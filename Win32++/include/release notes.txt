About Win32++
-------------
Win32++ is simple and easy to understand framework for developing Win32 
applications using C++. It brings an object oriented approach to programming 
directly with the Win32 API. Each window created is a C++ class object capable 
of having its own window procedure for routing messages.

Win32++ supports the following compilers and development environments:
* Borland C++ Compiler 5.5
* Borland Developer Studio 2006
* Dev-C++
* Microsoft Visual C++ Toolkit 2003
* Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Express Edition
* Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Express Edition
* Microsoft Visual Studio 6.0
* Microsoft Visual Studio.net 2003
* Microsoft Visual Studio.net 2005
* Microsoft Visual Studio.net 2008
* MinGW compiler

Win32++ supports the following operating systems
* Windows 95
* Windows 98
* Windows ME
* Windows NT 4
* Windows 2000
* Windows XP 	(32bit and 64bit)
* Windows 2003 Server (32bit and 64bit)
* Windows Vista	(32bit and 64bit)
* Windows 2008 Server (32bit and 64bit)
* Windows CE from WCE400 (Windows mobile 2003) to WCE600 (Windows mobile 6)

Getting Started
---------------
Each file download includes the project files for Dev-C++, CodeBlocks and the
various compilers from Microsoft. CodeBlocks is an IDE (Integrated Development
Environment) that supports GNU GCC, Borland Developer Studio 2006 and Microsoft
C++ Toolkit 2003.

Start with one of the generic starters, and add your code.

For additional information on getting started, refer to the tutorial included
in the documentation.
