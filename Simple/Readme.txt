This project demonstrates how to use Win32++ to create a simple window.  The
CView class controls the view window. The CSimpleApp starts Win32++ and runs
the message loop.

The files in the src directory are intended as templates for other programs.  
The library files in the Win32++ directory are intended to be used without 
modification.
