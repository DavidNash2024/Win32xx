Explorer Example
================
This example demonstrates how to work directly with the Shell Namespace to 
produce an explorer-like utility. The Shell namespace organizes the file system
and other objects managed by the Shell into a single tree-structured hierarchy. 
Conceptually, it is a larger and more inclusive version of the file system.

The Shell Namespace is managed through the IShellFolder interface.  The 
CShellFolder class is used to wrap the various members of the IShellFolder 
interface.

This sample also demonstrates the use of PIDLs (Pointer to Item Identifier List)
to walk through the file system. The various functions used to work with the
PIDLs are wrapped up in the Cpidl class.


Features demonstrated in this example
=====================================
* Displaying large toolbar buttons with text.
* Using a drop down menu with a toolbar button.
* Implementing splitter windows using CDocker.
* Using a TreeView control and ListView control as a view window for CDocker.
* Using PIDLs to walk through the file system.
* Use of the IShellFolder interface object to work directly with the Shell 
   Namespace.
