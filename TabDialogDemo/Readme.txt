Dialog Example
--------------

This program has a modal dialog as its main window.

A class derived from CDialog is used to create the dialog.  The files
for this are located in the WinDev++ directory, and the code
is lcoated in the WinDevxx namespace.

The CMyDialog and CDialogApp classes are intended as templates for other 
programs.  The classes within the WinDevxx namespace are intended to 
be used without modification.
