32bit and 64bit operating systems.

Directory Structure
===================
When extracting the files from the zip archive, be sure to preserve the
directory structure. The directory structure will look like this:

.\help
.\include
.\output
.\samples
.\tools
.\tutorials

The files that form the Win32++ library are contained in the include
folder.
