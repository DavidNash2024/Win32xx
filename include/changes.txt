Version 7.2
===========

New Features and Enhancements
-----------------------------
* Added CString class
   The CString class is intended to provide much of the same functionality
   as the CString class provided with MFC/ATL.
* Added CMenu
	The CMenu class is intended to provide much of the same functionality
    as the CMenu class provided with MFC. The library now standardises on
    using pointers to CMenu, instead of HMENU.	
* Added CFile
	This class provides a convenient wrapper for functions dealing with files.
* Added Idle processing.
	The Idle processing is used by the Win32++ library for some internal 
	processing. It is also available for use by users, and is used in much the
	same way as OnIdle processing in MFC.
* Enhanced the CDC class, and added CWindowDC, CClientDC, CMemDC, CPaintDC
   and CMetaFileDC. The creation of the various different types of CDCs has
   been simplified, and the CDC functions now use CDC pointers instead of
   HDCs. These changes improve the compatibility between Win32++ and MFC.
* Enhanced the various GDI object classes, namely CBitmap, CBrush, CFont, 
   CPalette, CPen and CRgn, and added CGDIObject. The library now standardises
   on using pointers to theses classes instead of raw GDI handles (like HPEN).
   These changes improve the compatibility between Win32++ and MFC.

Incompatibilities with previous versions
----------------------------------------
* The Win32++ now uses Run Time Type Information (RTTI). Older Microsoft
  compilers (Visual Studio 2003 and earlier) may need to enable the option to
  support RTTI.
* LoadString now returns a CString.
* CWnd::OnEraseBkgnd has changed. This function now uses a CDC pointer instead
   of a CDC reference. This change will need to be made for any function that
   overrides OnEraseBkgnd in order for it to get called.
* CWnd::OnPaint has been removed and replaced with OnPaint.  Code that previously 
   overrode OnPaint will now need to override OnPaint instead. OnPaint uses a 
   CDC pointer, not a CDC reference.
* Changes made to the CDC class (and the addition of CClientDC, CWindowDC, CMemDC,
   etc.) are rather likely to affect existing code.
    - CDC functions now use a CDC pointer argument instead of a HDC.
	- CWnd functions like GetDC return a pointer to a CDC instead of a HDC.
	- use CClientDC for client window DCs instead of CDC MyDC = GetDC().
	- use CWindowDC for window DCs instead of CDC MyDC = GetWindowDC().
	- use CMemDC for memory DCs instead of CDC MyDC = CreateCompatibleDC(dc).
	- use CDC::FromHandle to conveniently convert a HDC provided to us by say 
	   CustomDraw to a CDC pointer.

	Coding example:
	  CClientDC dcClient(this);			// Create a client window DC for this CWnd
      CMemDC dcMem(&dcClient);			// Create a Memory DC from the Client DC.
      CMemDC.CreatePen(PS_SOLID, 1, RGB(255,0,0);
	  CMemDC.MoveTo(0, 0);
      CMemDC.LineTo(50, 50);
	  dcClient.BitBlt(0, 0, cx, cy, &CMemDC, 0, 0); 
	
Version 7.1.3
=============
This version has some additional bug fixes:
* Fixed a thread safety issue in CWinApp::SetTLSIndex introduced in version 7.1.2.
* Added CWinApp::PreTranslateMessage to simplify overloading CWinApp::MessageLoop.
* The Explorer sample now ends without throwing an exeption on Win2000.
* CResizer now preserves the tab order in a dialog.

Version 7.1.2
=============
This version has some additional bug fixes: 
* CDC Attach and CDC(HDC hDC) now succeed when the HDC is already attached to another CDC.
* Fixed a resource leak in CTab::Paint which affected CTab, CTabbedMDI and CDockContainer
* Tabs without owner draw now display their icons.
* A CDC can now be reused after its HDC has been detached.
* CBrush::CBrush(COLORREF crColor) now works as expected.                 
* CResize now supports controls that issue WM_HSCROLL and WM_VSCROLL messages.

Version 7.1.1
=============
Version 7.1.1 has some minor bug fixes for 7.1, namely:
* Corrected an incorrect dock size when docking a docker.
* Corrected a drawing error in the tutorials and scribble sample which occurred when 
  dragging the mouse over the view window with the left button down.
* Added a missing typedef for BSTR2T.

Version 7.1
===========
New Features and Enhancements
-----------------------------
* Added support for Task Dialogs
* Added the following set of GDI classes: CBitmap, CBrush, CFont, CPalette, 
   CPen and CRgn. These work in cooperation with the existing CDC class.
* Added a set of new Text conversion functions based on classes.
   The complete set of functions are:
	A2BSTR		ANSI  to BSTR
	A2OLE		ANSI  to OLE
	A2T			ANSI  to TCHAR
	A2W			ANSI  to WCHAR
	OLE2A		OLE   to ANSI
	OLE2T		OLE   to TCHAR
	OLE2W		OLE   to WCHAR
	T2A			TCHAR to ANSI
	T2BSTR		TCHAR to BSTR
	T2OLE       TCHAR to OLE
	T2W			TCHAR to Wide
	W2A			WCHAR to ANSI
	W2BSTR		WCHAR to BSTR
	W2OLE		WCHAR to OLE
	W2T			WCHAR to TCHAR
   Refer to the help documentation for instructions on using these functions.
* Added CLoadString (and LoadString) to return a string resource. 
* OnEraseBkgnd is now called automatically when a CWnd's background needs
   erasing. Return TRUE to prevent default erasure.
* Scribble Tutorial now demonstrates the use of command line arguments
* Enhanced CResizer.
   - The anchor points are now fixed instead of proportional
   - Scrollbars are now added when required.
   - Added the DialogResizing sample to demonstrate CResizer's new features.
* Create now use a CWnd pointer instead of a HWND when specifying the 
   parent window.
* Dialogs and Property Sheets now use a CWnd pointer instead of a HWND
   when specifying the parent window.
* CTab has been enhanced. The TCS_FIXEDWIDTH and TCS_OWNERDRAWFIXED styles
   are now optional.   
* Extended the CSize, CPoint and CRect classes
* Extended CMDIFrame and CMDIChild. CMDIChild::SetHandles is now used to set
   the MDI child's menu and accelerator table. 
* A docker can now be resized while docked using CDocker::SetDockSize.
* Extended the "Using Win32++ section of the Win32++ help documentation.

The problem with the previous the text functions
------------------------------------------------
While the previous text conversion functions generally worked well, there were
ambiguities about usage, and corner cases where they produced undesirable 
results. For example:
// Problem 1
// This worked well
   ExampleFunction(CharToTChar(pAnsi1));

// But this failed to produce expected results
   ExampleFunction(CharToTChar(pAnsi1), CharToTChar(pAnsi2));

Problem 2
// This worked as expected
   LPCTSTR pStr = CharToTChar(pAnsi1);

// But this fails to work as expected
   LPCTSTR pStr1 = CharToTChar(pAnsi1);
   LPCTSTR pStr2 = CharToTChar(pAnsi2);

The new text conversion functions (classes) resolve problem 1 and render all of
problem 2's usage invalid (making usage less ambiguous).   

Refer to the "Text Conversions" topic in the "Using Win32++" section of the 
help documentation that ships with Win32++ for information on how to use the
new functions. 

Incompatibilities with previous versions
----------------------------------------
* The old text conversion functions have been replaced with a set of new functions
   which look and behave more like the functions used in MFC, ATL and WTL.
* Windows, dialogs and property sheets now use a CWnd pointer instead of a HWND
   to specify the parent window.
* CTab defaults to not using the CS_FIXEDWIDTH and TCS_OWNERDRAWFIXED styles. 
   The SetFixedWidth and SetOwnerDraw functions can be used to change these
   styles.
* Users of Borland's C++ compiler version 5.5 will need to install the 
   compiler's service pack 2 for stringsteam support.
* MDI Children use SetHandles instead of SetChildMenu to set the menu. SetHandles
   also sets the MDI child's accelerator table (if any).
* LoadString now returns a tString instead of a LPCTSTR.   

Version 7.0.2
=============
* Fix for a memory leak in CDC
* Fix for accelerators in WinCE
* Fix for menu check marks when themes are disabled
* Fix for OnMessageReflect in dialogs

Version 7.0.1
=============
* Supports the latest version of MinGW compiler
* DialogProc now returns INT_PTR instead of BOOL
* Fixed several x64 warnings
* Fixed DragAcceptFiles error when WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN is defined
* Added OnPaint to CDialog and CPropertyPage
* Minor update to the documentation
* Added targetver.h to samples
* Supports VS2010's resource editor

Incompatibilities with previous versions
----------------------------------------
DialogProc now returns INT_PTR instead of BOOL. This change will be required
in user code as well.


Version 7.0
===========

New Features and Enhancements
-----------------------------
* The following function now return CWnd* instead of HWND:
   GetActiveWindow, GetAncestor, GetCapture, GetFocus, GetDlgItem, GetWindow,
   GetLastAtivePopup, GetParent, GetTopWindow, SetActiveWindow, SetCapture, 
   SetFocus, and SetParent.  This helps the framework to be more object
   orientated, by allowing the programmer to work more directly with CWnds.
   It also reduces the need to convert between CWnds and HWNDs in user code.
   If a CWnd object for the HWND doesn't already exist, Win32++ creates a 
   temporary CWnd. The pointers returned by these functions should not be
   stored and used later, as they might not be valid then.
* Added CThread class to simplify the task of using threads and creating
   windows in different threads. CThread can be used for both worker threads
   and GUI threads. Refer to the Thread and DirectX samples for examples of 
   how to use CThread to create windows in a different thread. The DirectX
   sample also uses a customized message loop for the thread.   
* Added the following control wrappers: CAnimation, CComboBox, CComboBoxEx,
   CProgressBar, CScrollBar, CSlider, and CSpinButton.
* Renamed CToolbar to CToolBar, CStatusbar to CStatusBar, CRebar to CReBar
   and CMenubar to CMenuBar. This matches the MFC names, and is also more 
   consistent with Win32++'s naming conventions.   
* Added support for re-sizable dialogs. The CResizer class has been added
   to dialog.h to facilitate dialog resizing. Refer to the forms sample for
   an example of how to put CResizer to use.
* Added IPv6 support to CSocket. The network samples have been updated to
   take advantage of IPv6 support. IP version 6 is supported on Vista 
   operating systems and newer.
* Added Shared_Ptr class. Note that a "shared_ptr" will be available for the
   updated C++ standard. It is already available with some modern compilers,
   and also for users of the Boost library. The "Shared_Ptr" class is intended
   as an alternative for those users who would like to use a "shared_ptr", but
   don't have access to one yet. Unlike auto-ptr's, shared_ptr's can be used
   to safely store pointers in vectors and other STL containers.
* Extended the CToolbar class.
* Added the GDIPlus sample to demonstrate how to use the GDIPlus library 
   provided with modern Windows operating systems (XP and above).
* Win32++ can now be run from inside a DLL. The "DLL" sample demonstrates how to
   put a Win32++ dialog in a dll, and run it from a test program.  
* Dialogs and Property Sheets now use DWLP_MSGRESULT to automatically handle the 
   value returned by notifications in their message handling. This allows a 
   dialog's controls to use custom draw.
* Improved the appearance of frames without themes. The frame sample demonstrates
   how override CMainFrame::OnCreate to customize the frame's appearance.
* Asserts are used more liberally to test for programming errors. Any message
   sent to a non-existent window, for example, will now assert. More asserts 
   are intended to help users write code that is more robust. Note that asserts
   are only evaluated in Debug mode, and have no effect in Release mode.
* Exceptions are thrown less often. They are now thrown to indicate a critical
   problem, outside the programmer's control. Throwing fewer exceptions results 
   in slightly smaller executables, and gives users more flexibility and 
   control over their own exception methodology. They are thrown when:
   - a window creation fails.
   - a critical dll cannot be loaded.
   - a window message cannot be routed to a CWnd object.
   - an attempt to read from or write to the registry fails unexpectedly.
* Vectors are now used as a replacement for all dynamically allocated arrays, 
   ensuring the arrays are automatically deleted when they go out of scope.
   Creating an array with "new" runs the risk of causing a memory leak,
   particularly when an exception is thrown. Using a vector to create the
   array guarantees that it will be deleted properly under all circumstances.
* The OnPaint function now uses a CDC reference as its argument instead of a 
   HDC. This simplifies the task of using a CDC when overriding OnPaint.
* Extended the help documentation.

Version 6.9
===========

New Features and Enhancements
-----------------------------
* Added a WebBrowser class called CWebBrowser.  This class provides a web 
   browser in a window. This class can be used as a view window anywhere 
   view windows are used, such as in frames, dockers, MDI Children, 
   Tabbed MDIs etc.  It has no dependence on ATL, greatly simplifying the 
   approach to adding a browser window to any application.  It can be compiled
   by any of the supported compilers including Dev-C++, MinGW and the Borland 
   compilers as well as the compilers from Microsoft.  
* Added an ActiveX host class called CAXWindow.
* The CTab, CMDITab, CDocker and CDockContainer classes are now flicker free,
   providing a more professional look during resizing and docker moving.
* Improved the dock targeting and dock hinting.   
* Introduced a new set of text conversion functions to convert between Ansi, 
   Unicode and Wide characters.
* CWnd objects can now report their type with GetWindowType.
* Modified the Browser sample to use the new CWebBrowser class. It also 
   demonstrates how to use an event sink to get notification of browser events.
* Added a Tray sample which demonstrates how to create an application 
   which can be minimised to the system tray, and restored.
* The visual editor that ships with VS2008 and VS2010 can now be used to
   modify the resource files (Resource.rc and resource.h) without mangling them.

Changes
-------
* The directory layout of Win32++ has changed. It now contains the following
  folders:
   help             The help for Win32++
   include          The Win32++ library for typical use
   lib              The static library files when they are build
   Library Projects The project files used to build the static library
   new projects     A set of projects to be used in your new projects 
   src              The Win32++ library for building the static library
   tests            A directory which contains the output of some tools
   tools            A set of useful batch files for Win32++ 

* The Win32++ include directory is specified within the project rather than
   hard coded into the source files. To specify a different location for the
   Win32++ files in a project, specify the "Additional Include Directories" for
   both "C/C++" and "Resources". 

* The projects now provide the option of compiling with a static library or
   directly from the file in Win32++\include. To build the static libraries,
   see below. 
   
* A set of projects have been supplied to build the Win32++ into a static 
   library. These projects are contained within the Win32++\Library Projects 
   folder. The lib file created is placed within the lib directory.

* The projects are now configured to take advantage of precompiled headers.
   
* A set of tools is now provided in the tools folder. They include a set of 
   batch files for compiling the examples and batch files to "clean" them.
     
* The CDC class has been extended. Several functions have been added, and
  CDC::GetDC has been renamed to CDC::GetHDC.
             
* Support has been added for Right to Left languages which include Hebrew and 
   Arabic. The CFrame and CDocker classes now honour the WS_EX_LAYOUTRTL 
   extended style used by these languages. To take advantage of this feature,
   use PreCreate to set this extended when using CFrame, CMDIFrame, CTab, 
   CTabbedMDI, and CDocker.
   
* OnInitialUpdate is now called after Attach or AttachDlgItem.

* IsChild now takes a HWND argument.
 
* Win32++ is now available as a single download, rather than a collection of
   files.

* Each program example now has a Readme.txt file which describes what it does,
   and the features it demonstrates.   


Version 6.6
===========
Changes
-------
* The number of arguments have changed for WndProc and WndProcDefault.
  - The HWND parameter has been dropped in both of these functions. It's
    presence was redundant and possibly confusing. Users will need to modify
    their WndProc and WndProc functions accordingly. If needed, the m_hWnd 
    member variable can be used in place of hwnd within the WndProc function.
* The number of arguments have changed for DialogProc and DialogProcDefault.
  - The HWND parameter has been dropped in both of these functions. It's
    presence was redundant and possibly confusing. Users will need to modify
    their WndProc and WndProc functions accordingly. If needed, the m_hWnd 
    member variable can be used in place of hwnd in the WndProc function.  
* Enhancements to docking, containers and tabs.
  - By default the dockers are immediately resized while the splitter bar is 
     being dragged. To defer resizing until the splitter bar is released, use
     SetDragAutoResize(FALSE).
  - The close and list buttons now indicate when they are hot and pressed.
  - Added SetTabText, SetTabImage and SwapTabs to the CTab class.
  - Minor improvements to the painting of tabs, containers and dockers.
* Enhancements to GDI graphics support.
  - The CDC class has been extended. It now includes wrapper functions for 
     the Device Context related functions.
  - Added the CBitmapInfoPtr class. This simplifies the use of the BITMAPINFO
     structure in functions like GetDIBits and SetDIBits.
  - Added GrayScaleBitmap function to gdi.h. It converts a colored bitmap to
     to gray-scale.     
* Automated menu updating.
  - When a menu is about to be displayed, OnUpdateMenu is called to provide
     an opportunity to modify the check state of the menu items.
* Enhancements to frames
  - The style of the rebarband is now specified in AddToolbarBand. This 
     facilities saving and restoring toolbar settings from the registry (as 
     demonstrated in the Themes example.)  
  - The Frame's ShowToolbar and ShowStatusbar states are now saved in the
     registry.
* Modification to CRect class
  - The various function now use references instead of naked pointers.    
* Updated the Themes example.
  - Added check boxes for the various rebar theme option
  - Added Hide/Show option for the additional toolbars
  - Save/Load the theme options in the registry
  - Save/Load the rebar band positions and styles in the registry
* Replaced the Form example with the DocViewForm example.
  - This example now demonstrates a form using a Doc/View architecture, much
     like the traditional Doc/View of MFC. 
  - Added OnUpdateMenu handling. 
* Updated the FastGDI example.
  - Added gray-scale transformation
  - Added file save.
  - Added Scroll bars.
* Updated the picture example.
  - Added Scroll bars.  
* Updated the DockContainer and DockTabbedMDI examples    
  - These examples now demonstrate how to theme a container's toolbar.   
   
      
Incompatibilities with previous versions
----------------------------------------
- WndProc now takes 3 arguments, not 4:
   WndProc(UINT uMsg, WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam);
- WndProcDefault now takes 3 arguments, not 4:
   WndProcDefault(UINT uMsg, WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam);
- DialogProc now takes 3 arguements, not 4:
   DialogProc(UINT uMsg, WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam);
- DialogProcDefault now takes 3 arguements, not 4:
   DialogProcDefault(UINT uMsg, WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam);
- CFrame::AddToolbarBand now requires three arguements
- The various CRect functions use references to RECT rather than pointers
- CWnd::IsVisable has been renamed to CWnd::IsWindowVisible
- CWnd::IsEnabled has been renamed to CWnd::IsWindowEnabled

Version 6.5
===========
Major Changes
-------------
* Added StaticLibrary example
   This example has the code to build Win32++ into a a static library, and also
   demonstrates the use of Precompiled Headers. More experienced users might
   prefer this approach as it provides for much faster compile times.
* Added CTab class. 
   This class is used by CContainer and CTabbedMDI, and can also be used as a
   view window.
* Added TabDemo example.
   Refer to the TabDemo example for a demonstration of how CTab class is
   used as a view window in a frame. TabDialogDemo also uses CTab. 
* Added CTabbedMDI class.
   A TabbedMDI can be used as a view window for a Frame or a Dockable. As the 
   name suggests, it provides tabs for a MDI window. 
* Added TabbedMDI example within docking.
   Refer to the docking TabbedMDI example for a demonstration of how CTabbedMDI
   class is used.   
* Enhancements to docking.
   - Dockers can now be docked into, and undocked from all other dockers, 
     including those that are undocked. 
   - Containers can also be docked into and undocked all from containers,
      including those that are undocked.
   - Containers can display their tabs at the top or bottom of the window.
   - Containers can also display a tab list button.
   - Docker and container objects are destroyed when their window is closed.
   - CContainer::SetupToolbar can be used to specify the toolbar's resource IDs.
   - Dockers and containers can save their layout in and load their layout from
      the registry.     
* Improvements to toolbars
   - Resource IDs should be specified in SetupToolbar, rather than CMainFrame's
      constructor.
   - Other configurations for the toolbar such as disabled buttons and alternate
      bitmaps should be specified in SetupToolbar, rather than in OnCreate.
   - Configuration of additional toolbars if any should also be done in
      SetupToolbar.  Refer to the Themes example for a demonstration of this.
   - CToolbar now holds the vector of Resource IDs, which can be retrieved
      with the GetToolbarData function. There is no need to specify a vector
      when adding additional toolbars.
   - There is now no need to specify the number of toolbar buttons in the
      AddBitmap, ReplaceBitmap, SetBitmap and SetImages functions.
   - The AddToolbarButton can now add a toolbar button which is initially
      disabled.
   - There is no need to call SetButtons when adding additional toolbars.
   - Tooltips for all toolbars in the rebar are now displayed.      
* MIN and MAX macros have been defined and can be used in place of min and max.
   This avoids incompatibilities between the way different compliers support
   these macros. It also avoids clashes between the macro definitions of 
   min and max, and the STL definitions of min and max.

Incompatiblities with previous versions
---------------------------------------
- Many of the functions associated with adding toolbars to frames have changed.
  CFrame::SetupToolbar should be overridden to perform toolbar configuration.
  Refer to the Themes example for a demonstration of how to add multiple toolbars
  to a frame.
- The renaming of the CFrame::OnXXXX may affect overloading. Calling the base
  function may now be required particularly for CFrame::OnNotify.
- The OnCommand handlers for OnViewStatusbar and OnViewToolbar have been removed
  from CFrame, and should be added to CMainFrame::OnCommand if required.
- CDocker has been renamed to CDocker
- dockable.h has been renamed to docking.h      
   
Version 6.4.1
=============
This release has the following bug fixes:
- Assertions in CContainer reported by VS2005(express) and VS2008(express)
- Definition of OPENFILENAME_SIZE_VERSION_400 added for VS6 

Version 6.4
===========

Major Changes
------------
* Docking:
  - Added tabbed docking container with optional toolbar
  - Added close button to the caption of docked windows
  - Added 'outer' docking  ie. docking at the side of the frame rather 
      than inside another Docker.
  - Added a second docking example demonstrating containers
  - Added save/restore dock layout to docking examples
  - Added Close All Dockables and Default Dock Layout to docking examples
  - Added Win98 and WinME support for docking. 
* Added Region support to CDC class.
* Notepad example enhancements:
  - Now capable of handling Unicode text
* Themes example now demonstrates a ComboBoxEx control in its toolbar  
 

Fixes
-----
Various fixes to docking, including:
 - Fixed Z order of undocked windows
 - Fixed focus for child windows
 - Improved undocking
 - Reduced flicker
 - Better sizing of docked windows
 
Incompatibilities with previous versions
----------------------------------------
* CWnd::m_hWndParent has been removed. Use GetParent() in its place.
* Some functions have been added to CWnd which have the same name as their 
   Win32 counterparts. Prefix functions with the global scope specifier '::' 
   to use the original Win32 API function instead of the Win32++ version.
* CSplitter has been superseded by CDocker. Use a CDocker with the
   DS_NO_UNDOCK and DS_NO_CAPTION styles to duplicate the behaviour of 
   CSplitter. CSplitter will be retained for backwards compatibility, as
   well as for those who require its 'immediate' mode.
   
More About Docking Containers
-----------------------------
A container can be used is a view window for a frame, MDI child, dockable etc.
It has a tab control, and is capable of containing and displaying other
containers. Each container will in turn have a view window of its own. The view 
for each container as well as it's toolbar (if any) is displayed in the tab's 
page. When used as the view window of a dockable, the container also permits
 docking and undocking of it's containers.  

In Summary:
* Any CWnd object inherited from CContainer is capable of containing other CWnd
   objects inherrited from CContainer. There is no theoretical limit as to the
   number of containers that can be contained.
* A child container (a container contained within another) can not in turn
   contain other containers.   
* Containers have a View window, just like Frames, MDI children and dockables.
* Containers can set an icon and text for the tab, as well as text for the 
   docking caption.
* Containers can optionally include a toolbar.
* When a container contains other containers, each container's view is displayed
   in a separate tab.
* When a container is the view  window for a dockable, any container children
   can be individually undocked from their parent container.
* When used a the view for a docker, a container with child containers can be
   undocked as a group.
* An undocked container group (container with children) can be docked as a
   group inside another docked container. 


Version 6.3
===========

Major Changes
-------------
* Added support for docking. See below for more information on Docking  
   - Note: CDocker is now recommended over CSplitter for splitter apps.     
* Added the Fast GDI demo. This demonstrates the use of the TintBitmap function.
* MDI child windows now require a view window. The use of a view window is 
   now the same for Frames, MDI children, and dockables. The MDI demo example
   has been extended to include ListView and TreeView views.
* Added message translation. This allows modeless dialogs and propertysheets
    to process the tab (and other) keys.
* Added a CWnd::Destroy function. This returns a CWnd back to its default
    state ready to be reused.
* SetView can now be used to change the frame's view from one CWnd to 
    another.
* The Frame now stores which child window had focus before it is de-activated,
    and returns focus to this child when the frame application is reactivated.    
    
    
Fixes
-----    
* CFrame now supports Extra Large fonts in the menu and status bar. Also, font
    size can be changed while the application is running.
* 16Bit colours (and grey-scale) are now rendered properly
* Tabbing now works for modeless dialogs and property sheets
   (uses PreTranslateMessage).            


Incompatibilities with previous versions
----------------------------------------
* MDI Child windows now require a view. Refer to the MDI Demo example for an
   example of how to add views to a MDI child.
* Some functions have been added to CWnd which have the same name as their 
   Win32 counterparts. Prefix functions with the global scope specifier '::' 
   to use the original Win32 API function instead of the Win32++ version.


More About Docking
------------------
* Any CWnd object inherited from CDocker is capable of docking other CWnd
    objects inherrited from CDocker.
* Dockables can be docked in any of the 4 sides. Any number of windows can be 
   docked on a side.
* A dockable could be docked inside another dockable which in turn is docked
   inside another. There is no theoretical limit as to depth of dockables 
   within dockables.
* Dockables have a View window, just like the Frame, and MDI children.
* Dockables are separated by a movable splitter bar.
* Dockables use a modern style of dock targeting and dock hinting (the same
    as Visual Studio 2005 and 2008).
* Dockables can have styles including:
  - DS_NOTDOCKED			   
  - DS_DOCKED_LEFT	   
  - DS_DOCKED_RIGHT   
  - DS_DOCKED_TOP		   
  - DS_DOCKED_BOTTOM  
  - DS_NODOCKCHILD_LEFT	 	
  - DS_NODOCKCHILD_RIGHT	 	
  - DS_NODOCKCHILD_TOP	 
  - DS_NODOCKCHILD_BOTTOM	 	
  - DS_NO_RESIZE				 
  - DS_NO_CAPTION		 
  - DS_NO_UNDOCK
* CDocker is now the recommended alternative to CSplitter (being much simpler
    to implement - see the example below). The DS_NO_CAPTION and DS_NO_UNDOCK
    styles should be specified if docking and undocking are not required.

Example of how to dock 8 dockables inside a dockable view:
----------------------------------------------------------
void CMainFrame::OnInitialUpdate()
{
    // CTextDockable in inherited from CDocker
	CDocker* pDockLeft   = m_DockView.AddDockedChild(new CTextDockable, DS_DOCKED_LEFT, 100);
	CDocker* pDockRight  = m_DockView.AddDockedChild(new CTextDockable, DS_DOCKED_RIGHT, 100);
	CDocker* pDockTop    = m_DockView.AddDockedChild(new CTextDockable, DS_DOCKED_TOP, 100);
	CDocker* pDockBottom = m_DockView.AddDockedChild(new CTextDockable, DS_DOCKED_BOTTOM, 100);

	// Dock 4 dockables inside other dockables
    pDockLeft->AddDockedChild(new CTextDockable, DS_DOCKED_BOTTOM, 100);
	pDockRight->AddDockedChild(new CTextDockable, DS_DOCKED_BOTTOM, 100);
	pDockTop->AddDockedChild(new CTextDockable, DS_DOCKED_RIGHT, 100);
	pDockBottom->AddDockedChild(new CTextDockable, DS_DOCKED_RIGHT, 100);
}      			   

(Refer to the Docking example for an example of to use CDocker.)    


Version 6.2
===========

Changes
-------
* The default colour scheme has been changed from blue to grey. 
  The blue, olive and silver colour schemes continue to be used on Windows XP
  with themes enabled. 

New Features
------------
* Frame applications now store the window size and position in the registry.
To enable this, set the m_KeyName member variable in CMainFrame's constructor.
This member variable can be used to reflect the company name and application
name, for example:
  m_KeyName = _T("SomeCompany\\SomeApp");
  
* Frame applications now provide a Most Recently Used (MRU) list. This list is 
stored in the registry.

* Extended CWnd
CWnd now includes functions which wrap many of the Windows API functions that 
affect to windows. 


Version 6.1
===========

New Features
------------
* All Win32++ code has been moved to header files.
This simplifies the use of Win32++. To add Win32++ to a project, simply 
include the appropriate Win32++ header files in your code. There is no longer
any need to add the Win32++ files to the project, although doing so may
still prove useful under some circumstances. Depending on the compiler/IDE
used, adding the Win32++ header files to the project may add the various 
Win32++ classes to the class view.
 
* Added CListView class.
This class encapsulates the various messages and macros used by the Win32/64 
API to manage the List-View common control. You can inherit from this class
when creating your own List-View control in a window, or attaching a 
List-View control from a dialog.

* Added CTreeView class.
This class encapsulates the various messages and macros used by the Win32/64 
API to manage the Tree-View common control. You can inherit from this class
when creating your own Tree-View control in a window, or attaching a 
Tree-View control from a dialog.

* Added CPoint CRect and CSize classes
The CPoint, CRect and CSize classes can be used anywhere a POINT, RECT
or CSize struct can be used respectively. In addition:
- The constructors ensure that members are set to reasonable values.
  They also allow a default value to be set when the class is used as a 
  function argument.
- The classes have additional member functions, including operator==
  and operator!= .   
- These classes makes porting code from MFC or WTL a little easier.

* Extended the CRebar, CToolbar and CStatusbar classes.


Version 6.0.2
=============

New Features
------------
* Added support for x64 applications.

Win32++ can now be used to build 64 bit applications. The manifest file has 
been modified to support both 32bit and 64bit applications. The new manifest
should be used for any 64 bit applications that use common controls.

Users are encouraged to use the modern Win64 API functions like:
GetWindowLongPtr, SetWindowLongPtr, GetClassLongPtr and SetClassLongPtr.
Win32++ will convert these back to their Win32 API counterparts if required.


Version 6.0.1
=============
Added    CFrame::SetMenuIcons
Added    CFrame::SetToolbarImages
Removed  CToolbar::SetToolbarImageList
Added    CToolbar::SetBitmap
Moved    CreateDisabledImageList to CFrame::CreateDisabledImageList
Modified CFrame::AddMenuIcons

New Features:
------------
* 32 bit bitmaps are now supported for toolbars (requires XP or Vista)
* SetMenuIcons and AddMenuIcons now also accept a bitmap for disabled icons
   in addition to the bitmap for normal icons.


Version 6.0
===========

New Features
------------
* Win32++ now also directly supports the Windows CE operating systems. 
   Windows CE is the operating system used on such things as Pocket PCs, 
   embedded systems and SmartPhones. The Win32++ examples for Windows CE
   include the project files for eMbedded Visual C++ 4.0, and Visual 
   Studio 2005.
   
* Added Networking support. Win32++ now includes a CSocket class which
   encapsulates much of the Winsock API. This class is capable of monitoring
   network events, such as connection requests from clients, and notification
   that the socket has data ready to be received. Command line and dialog
   examples are provide to demonstrate how the class can be used to create
   TCP/IP (and UDP/IP) servers and clients.
  
* Added a CDC class. This class simplifies the drawing to device contexts. 
   This class can be used anywhere we would normally use a handle to a 
   device context (HDC). Its features include:
   - Automates the selection of GDI objects into the device context.
   - Automates the destruction of GDI objects.
   - Automates the deletion or release of the device contexts.
   
* PreRegisterClass can now be used to set the WNDCLASS parameters before the
   window class is registered. This provides a convenient way to set a window's 
   background brush or cursor.
   
* Improvements to tracing. It now uses OutputDebugString to send the trace
   output the debug/output pane of the various IDE's. This is now also 
   compatible with debuggers, should you choose to use them. Previously the 
   tracing created a separate window to display text.

* Added an immediate mode to CSplitter. There is now the choice of resizing
   the panes while the splitter bar is being dragged, or defer the resizing
   until the splitter bar drag is complete (as before). CSplitter's 
   constructor now requires no arguments, making the class simpler to use.
   
* Automatically detects the XP theme used (Default, Silver or Olive), and
   adjusts the theme colors accordingly.
   
* Added project files for Borland's Turbo C++ 2006. This is a free compiler
   available from Borland. It can be downloaded here: 
   http://www.codegear.com/downloads/free/turbo

* Enhanced the tutorial. It now also demonstrates file operations and printing.

  
Version 5.6
===========
* Property Sheets are now supported. The files PropertySheet.cpp and 
   PropertySheet.h have been added to Win32++. These files define
   the CPropertySheet and CPropertyPage classes. The Property sheet generic 
   demonstrates the following:
  - Modal property sheets.
  - Modeless property sheets.
  - Wizards.    


Version 5.5
===========
* Added Menubar theme support
  - Gradient background for hot buttons (any two colors)
  - Gradient background for pressed buttons (any two colors)
  - Gradient Sidebar for menu items based on pressed button colors.
  - A border color for Menubar buttons and selected menu items


Version 5.4
===========
* Added Rebar themes, including:
  - Gradient background for the rebar control (any two colors)
  - Gradient background for the rebar bands (any two colors)
  - The Menubar can be locked in place.
  - The bands can be kept left.
  - Short bands
  - Bands can have rounded borders
  - Bands with rounded borders can have a flat style
* Added Toolbar themes, including:
  - Gradient background for hot buttons (any two colors)
  - Gradient background for pressed buttons (any two colors)
  - Colored outline for hot and pressed buttons (any color)
* Built in support for multiple toolbars (in rebars) with AddToolbarBand
* Added Forms example
* Added Themes example


Version 5.3
===========
* Owner drawn drop down menu items with icons.  CMenubar::SetIcons is
   used to determine which menu items display an icon. By default, the
   framework uses the toolbar's bitmap and resource IDs for displaying 
   icons. Override CFrame::SetButtons to change this behavior.
* Automatic subclassing for windows using Windows API defined window classes.
   Now when a window is based on predefined window classes, like the 
   common controls (e.g. list-view, tree-view, richedit), the window is
   automatically subclassed. There is now no need to call the subclass
   function in user code.   


Version 5.2
===========
* Added a separate HINSTANCE for resources. This provides for multilingual
   support, when resources are loaded via a DLL.
* Added the Internet Browser example. It demonstrates how to host an ActiveX
   control in a Win32++ window. It requires ATL.
* Added the Performance example. This program now also conducts a simple 
   performance test to measure the efficiency of the message handling. 

   
Version 5.1
===========
* Existing windows can be subclassed and converted to CWnd objects using Attach
* Dialog items can be sublcassed and converted to CWnd objects, using 
   AttachDlgItem.
* Improvements to CToolbar. The toolbar uses image lists which support using 
  separate bitmaps for normal, hot and disabled buttons. Text can be added
  to toolbar buttons, and the style can be set.
* Improvements to CStatusbar.  
* Notifications from common controls are reflected back to the CWnd object that
  generated them. 
* Messages from old style common controls are reflected back to the CWnd object
  that generated them.
  

Version 5.0
===========
* Added rebars to the frame window
* Added a menubar to the frame window
* Added MDI frame support
* Added splitter window support


Version 4
=========
* Changed the method of associating the Window's handle (HWND) and 
   the CWnd pointer.  Previously SetWindowLong was used to store the 
   CWin pointer in the windows data area. Now std::map is used to 
   associate a CWnd pointer with the HWND (i.e. the window's handle).   
* Added the lpParam parameter to both versions of the CWnd::CreateEx
   function.  Users are now free to use lpParam for their own 
   purposes. This parameter defaults to NULL for backwards 
   compatibility.
        

Version 3
=========
* Added Tracing. To use tracing, ensure that you are in Debug mode, 
   i.e. the variable _DEBUG is defined, and use the TRACE("xxxxx")
   function to send trace messages.  The first TRACE(...) creates 
   the Trace output window.   
* Enhanced the error reporting in the event of an exception. The 
   GetLastError information is now decoded and displayed if it 
   provides any additional information.
* Added support for multi-threaded applications.    
    

Version 2
=========
* The code is now Unicode compliant.
* Added CWinApp class to start Win32++.
* Added CDialog class to support modal and modeless dialogs as well
   as indirect dialogs (dialogs created from a dialog template in
   memory).
* Added the Create function to simplify window creation.
    

Version 1.0
