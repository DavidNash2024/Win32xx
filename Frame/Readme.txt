Frame Window
------------

This program has a frame window which includes a Tool Bar and 
Status Bar.  A child view window is super-imposed over the client
area of the frame window.

Classes derived from CWnd are used to create the windows.  The files
for this are located in the Windows subdirectory, and the code
is lcoated in the Windows namespace.

The CView, CApp and CMainFrame classes are intended as templates for
other programs.  The classes within the Windows namespace are intended
to be used without modification.
