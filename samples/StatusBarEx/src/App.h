    Contents Description: Declaration of the CApp class for a sample program 
    demonstrating the use of the status bar using the Win32++ Windows 
    framework, Copyright (c) 2005-2017 David Nash.

    This particular program was adapted from the StatusBar sample progam
    in the Win32++ distribution by Robert C. Tausworthe to illustrate the 
    definition of the status bar makeup by way of a data structure, in a
    similar fashion as that appearing in the Microsoft Foundation Classes 
    (MFC), and to override the Win32++ normal statusbar definition of four 
    parts to any number suitable for an application.

    The code changes to the StatusBar sample program only occur in the 
    CMainFrame and MyStatusBar classes. However, the entire program has
    been reformatted for better readability, per the Programming Notes,
    below.

    These materials are provided "as is", without warranty of any kind,

    Programming Notes:
                The programming conventions used here roughly follow those 
        established by the 1997-1999 Jet Propulsion Laboratory Deep 
        Space Network Planning and Preparation Subsystem project for 
        C++ programming.
