Titlebar Frame Sample
=====================
This sample adapts the features demonstrated with the titlebar sample for 
use with a frame. The frame can be presented in either of two modes.

The full-frame mode has the following features:
 - The caption is displayed in the frame's titlebar.
 - The menu is displayed by CMenubar within the rebar control.
 - The toolbar is displayed within the rebar control.

The mini-frame mode has the following features:
 - The menu is displayed by CMenubar in the frame's titlebar.
 - The toolbar is displayed within the rebar control.


Background
==========
Modern window operating systems (since windows 7) use the Windows Desktop 
Manager (DWM) to manage the the non-client area of top-level windows. This 
impacts on the way we can draw the non-client for these windows. The default
processing of the WM_NCPAINT message has changed, and handling the WM_NCPAINT
message to draw on the non-client area is now deprecated.


About this code
===============
This code uses information published here: 
https://github.com/grassator/win32-window-custom-titlebar
The MIT licence for the original code is included with this software.

This program handles the WM_NCCALCSIZE to remove the title bar from the
window's non-client and add it to the window's client area. We then draw our
custom title bar within the handling of WM_PAINT.  
 

This sample demonstrates the following:
======================================
* Handles the WM_NCCALCSIZE message to adjust the non-client area size.
* Handles the WM_NCHITTEST message for hit testing on our custom title bar.
* Handles the WM_GETMINMAXINFO message to limit the minimum window size.
* Uses ::OpenThemeData to access the windows's theme data.
* Uses ::GetDpiForWindow to retrieve the DPI for the window.
* Uses ::DrawThemeTextEx to draw the tile bar caption.
* Draws a custom title bar with minimize, maximize and close buttons.
* Draws an icon on the title bar.
* Displays a system menu when the icon on the title bar is clicked.
* Positions a child view window over the view area of the window.
* Uses double buffer when drawing the contents of the view window.
* Overrides CFrame<T>::RecalcLayout to reposition the frame's child windows.
* Adjusts the position of the frame's rebar control.
* Overrides GetViewRect to adjust the frame's view area.
* Uses CRebar::ShowBand to dynamically show or hide a rebar band.
