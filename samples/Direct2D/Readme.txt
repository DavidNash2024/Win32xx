About Direct2D
--------------
Direct2D is a hardware-accelerated, immediate-mode 2-D graphics API that provides high performance and high-quality rendering for 2-D geometry, bitmaps, and text. The Direct2D API is designed to interoperate with existing code that uses GDI, GDI+, or Direct3D.

Direct2D is implemented in Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8, and Windows 10. To compile this demo, use a Microsoft compiler with the Windows 7 SDK.
