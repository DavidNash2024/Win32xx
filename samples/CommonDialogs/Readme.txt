CommonDialogs Example
=====================

This sample program has a frame window which includes a menu bar, tool bar,
and status bar, with a modeless dialog as the client window of the frame. 
It is meant to serve as the template for applications that require a full 
range of features, including AboutBox help, full color selection of frame, 
controls, and client area, font selection for text display, standard file 
open and save-as dialogs, selection and use of printers, and serialization 
of the program's persistent parameters and the most-recently used list (MRU) 
data relegated to CArchive files located in the user's Application Data 
folder.

Features demonstrated in this example
=====================================

* App-Doc-Frame-View Single Document Interface (SDI) program architecture 
  much like MFC applications.

* Use of CFrame to provide a frame window (docking not supported).

* Extension of CMainFrame to add serialization of the MRU list and display of
  items that exceed the set maximum length using the  ellipsis "..." in the 
  middle of the truncated string, rather than at its beginning, as in Win32++.

* Generation of the basic set of string variables in CApp::InitInstance(), 
  such as the application title, file name with extension, version number, 
  full path name and the directory part of that path, the data archive file 
  path name and its directory, the Win32++ framework  version number, the 
  compiler with its version number, the date of compilation, the document
  extension, file dialog filter, and candidate information that will appear 
  in the AboutBox when activated. It also provides the size of the maximum 
  Most Recently Used (MRU) file list.

* Use of the Win32++ CArchive class to store and retrieve the frame settings 
  (including MRU list, status and toolbar display switches, and window
  placement), as well as perhaps some document status data. The frame's 
  persistent data is  stored in the path named 

    <app_data_path>\win32++\CommonDialogs.arc

  where <the app_data_path> is found using the Win32++ GetAppDataPath() 
  function.  

* Use of the entire Win32++ common dialog classes (CFontDialog, CColorDialog,
  CFileDialog, CFindReplace, CPrintDialog, and CPageSetupDialog) for selection 
  of fonts, colors, files, text for find/replace purposes, and printer 
  parameters.

* Reusable classes CColorChoice and CListBoxDlg that, with CView, implement 
  the selection and display of the font foreground, font background, and 
  control colors for the RichEdit control, as well as the colors of the dialog
  and status bar backgrounds.

* Reusable derived classes MyFileDlg, MyFindReplaceDlg, MyFontDlg, MyPrintDialog,
  and MyPrintSetup that customize the appearance of their respective common
  dialog base classes and bring context help functions to these dialogs.

* Programmer-selectable menu, tool bar, and status bar themes, as well as
  user-selectable foreground and background colors of the dialog controls,
  client area, and status bar.

* Tool tips that appear when the mouse hovers over tool bar, dialog controls,
  and the dialog client area.

* Display of program title, executable name, program version number, Win32++ 
  version number, compiler name, and most recent compilation date in the 
  AboutBox dialog.

* MRU strings that are recovered from serialization that are not valid file 
  paths are discarded at program startup by the CMainFrame::ValidateMRU() 
  method. In this way, files that may have been deleted between executions
  do not adversely affect operations.

* Use of a CRichEdit control as a file view window with extensive editing
  and access capabilities, including cut, copy, paste, undo, redo, save, 
  save as, drag-and-drop, and print capabilities. The control is limited 
  to textual content. Only ABSI/UTF8 text operation is accommodated. For a
  full Unicode capability consult the NotePad sample program of this release. 

* Addition of the CPrintInfo and CPrintView classes for printing of documents.
  These emulate the manner of printing found in MFC applications. A special
  CPrintRichView class derived from CPrintView handles the printing of the
  rich edit window contents. Print preview and printing of multiple copies 
  are not supported.
