This folder contains the projects help and settings file. 
Run the Install.bat file to copy these files to the user's AppData folder.

Note:
All operating systems Win2000 and above are able to store user files within
the AppData folder. Earlier operating systems (Win98 for example) expect to
have the user files in the same folder as the executable.
