	Contents Description:  Resource Definitions used by the CommonDialogs
	SDI sample application resource.rc file.  Adapted to the Win32++
	Windows interface classes, Copyright (c) 2005-2016 David Nash, under
	permissions granted therein.

        Caveats: The copyright displayed above extends only to the author's

		The above copyright notice, as well as that of David Nash
		and Win32++, together with the respective permission
		conditions shall be included in all copies or substantial
		portions of this material so copied, modified, merged,
		published, distributed, or otherwise held by others.

	These materials are provided "as is", without warranty of any kind,
	express or implied, including but not limited to: warranties of
	merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.
	In no event shall the authors or copyright holders be liable for any
	claim, damages, or other liability, whether in an action of contract,
	tort or otherwise, arising from, out of, or in connection with, these
	materials, the use thereof, or any other other dealings therewith.

	Special Conventions:  The specification of IDs for resource objects
	generally adhere to prefixes as shown in the following table. Note
	that different kinds of resource objects have different prefixes to
	distinguish the types of entities they belong to:

	        Entity ID 	Object
		IDP_ 		Message-box prompt
		IDD_ 		Dialog-box ID
		ID_             Standard MFC toolbar and menu command
		IDT_		Toolbar command
		IDM_		Menu command
		IDR_ 		Frame-related resource
		IDC_ 		Control resource
		IDW_            Win32++ default resources

	Notes about Resource IDs: In general, resource IDs can have values
	from 1 to 65535. Programs with resource IDs higher than 65535 may
	not be supported by some Windows versions.

	* Windows uses the icon with the lowest resource ID as the
	application icon. The Win32++ default_resource.h file defines this
	identifier as IDW_MAIN. The other default system identifiers it
	defines are all numbered below 100 and are all prefixed IDW_. These
	include resource IDs for MENU, ICON, ToolBar Bitmap, Accelerator,
	and Window Caption.

	* The Windows Platform SDK defines the WM_APP constant as a value
	to be used by applications to define private messages that do not
	conflict with system messages. The Win32++ suite is viewed as an
	application by the WINAPI and preempts the first 24 (in version 7.6.1)
	of these, so this file defines its resource IDs beginning at a
	reasonable distance above this, to allow for their future expansion.
	This value is defined as THIS_APP, below.

	* If multiple static controls appear in a dialog, these should be
	given unique identifiers if they are active. Otherwise, an ID of -1
	is used to designate these static controls do not actively participate
	in the application.

	Programming Notes:
                The programming standards roughly follow those established
                by the 1997-1999 Jet Propulsion Laboratory Deep Space Network
		Planning and Preparation Subsystem project for C++ programming.
