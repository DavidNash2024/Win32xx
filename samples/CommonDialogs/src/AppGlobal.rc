    Contents: This file defines the CAppGlobal resources for a base
    application. CAppGlobal class requires a set of resources pertaining to
    the particular application being built. Usage of this capability thus
    requires that this file be copied into the src space of the application
    files and edited with application-secific values.  This is consistent
    with the Win32++ WINAPI interface, Copyright (c) 2005-2016 David Nash,
    under permissions granted therein.

        Caveats: The copyright displayed above extends only to the author's
        treatment of material that may have been extracted from cited sources.
    Unaltered portions of those materials retain their original copyright
    status. The author's additions and modifications may be used or altered
    by others for non-commercial use only without permission.  However,
    citation of the author's work should be included in such usages.

    These materials are provided "as is", without warranty of any kind,
    express or implied, including but not limited to: warranties of
    merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.
    In no event shall the authors or copyright holders be liable for any
    claim, damages, or other liability, whether in an action of contract,
    tort or otherwise, arising from, out of, or in connection with, these
    materials, the use thereof, or any other other dealings therewith.
    
    Implementation Notes:  The file dialog document type filter is a string
    used to determine the types of names that files must have in order to be
    displayed in the file list box. This string consists of substring pairs,
    each of which specifies a descriptor and a type (or types). The first
    substring in each pair describes the filter; the second specifies the
    file extension (i.e., type) that applies. Multiple extensions may be
    specified using ‘;’ as the delimiter. Each substring ends with the ‘|’
    character and the entire string terminates in "||\0".

    Acknowledgement:
        The author would like to thank and acknowledge the advice,
        critical review, insight, and assistance provided by David Nash
        in the development of this work.

    Programming Notes:
               The programming standards roughly follow those established
                by the 1997-1999 Jet Propulsion Laboratory Deep Space Network
        Planning and Preparation Subsystem project for C++ programming.
