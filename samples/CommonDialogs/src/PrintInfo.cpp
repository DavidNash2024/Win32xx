	Contents Description: Implementation of the CPrintInfo class for
	applications using the Win32++ Windows interface classes, Copyright
	(c) 2005-2016 David Nash, under permissions granted therein. The class
	is described further below.

        Caveats: The copyright displayed above extends only to the author's
	original contributions to the subject class, and to the alterations,
	additions, deletions, and other treatments of materials that may have
	been extracted from the cited sources.  Unaltered portions of those
	materials retain their original copyright status. The author hereby
	grants permission to any person obtaining a copy of this treatment
	of the subject class and any associated documentation composed by

	restriction or limitation, subject to the following conditions:

		The above copyright notice, as well as that of David Nash
		and Win32++, together with the respective permission
		conditions shall be included in all copies or substantial
		portions of this material so copied, modified, merged,
		published, distributed, or otherwise held by others.

	These materials are provided "as is", without warranty of any kind,
	express or implied, including but not limited to: warranties of
	merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.
	In no event shall the authors or copyright holders be liable for any
	claim, damages, or other liability, whether in an action of contract,
	tort or otherwise, arising from, out of, or in connection with, these
	materials, the use thereof, or any other other dealings therewith.

	About the CPrintInfo class: CPrintInfo stores information about a print
	or print-preview job. The CPrintView class creates a CPrintInfo object
	each time the Print or Print Preview command is chosen and destroys it
	once the printing task is completed.

	During the CPrintView cycle, the CPrintInfo object contains persistent
	information about the print job as a whole, such as the range of pages
	to be printed and the current status of the print job, including the
	page currently being printed. Some of this information is obtained from,
	and given into, an associated CPrintDialog object; the CPrintInfo object
	retains the values entered by the user in the Print dialog box. This
	information remains as the CPrintDialog object goes out of scope. (This
	is different than the MFC version of this class).

	A CPrintInfo object is passed between the base CPrintView class and its
	derived class during the printing process and is used to exchange
	information between the two. For example, the base class informs the
	derived class which page of the document to print by assigning a value
	to the m_nCurPage member of CPrintInfo; the derived class retrieves this
	value and performs the actual printing of the specified page.

	Another example is the case in which the length of the document is not
	known until it is printed. In this situation, the derived class may
	test for the end of the document each time a page is printed. When the
	end is reached, the derived class may set the m_bContinuePrinting member
	of CPrintInfo to FALSE; this informs the base class to stop the print
	loop.

 	Acknowledgement:
		The author would like to thank and acknowledge the advice,
		critical review, insight, and assistance provided by David Nash
		in the development of this work.

	Programming Notes:
               The programming standards roughly follow those established
                by the 1997-1999 Jet Propulsion Laboratory Deep Space Network
		Planning and Preparation Subsystem project for C++ programming.
