<title>Compiled HTML Help for MinGW Win32 Application</title>
</head>

<body>
<h2>Adding Compiled HTML Help to a MinGW Win32 Application</h2>
<ul>

  <li><h3>Get MS HTML Help Workshop</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Go to <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/htmlhelp/html/hwmicrosofthtmlhelpdownloads.asp">MSDN</a>, download (free) the help workshop and install.</li>
      <li>In C:\Program Files\HTML Help Workshop\include there's a header file htmlhelp.h. Put a copy in C:\MinGW\include.</li>
      <li>In C:\Program Files\HTML Help Workshop\lib there's a library 
file htmlhelp.lib. Put a copy in C:\MinGW\lib under the name 
libhtmlhelp.a. Renaming to the MinGW convention is not actually 
necessary, but it makes the nature of the file clearer. As found by the 
MinGW project staff, this file is a static library that calls 
LoadLibrary/GetProcAddress to access the file 
C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32\hhctrl.ocx, not an import library, and can be linked
 by ld.</li>
    </ul><br>
  </li>
  
  <li><h3>Create the help file</h3>
<p>No directions will be given here for producing a compiled help file 
with the workshop. At the simplest, a single-page HTML file can be 
"compressed" in the Workshop, omitting contents, index and word search. 
(The CHM for a simple HTML file was bigger than the original, presumably
 from overhead in the CHM format.)</p>
  </li>
  
  <li><h3>Include a Help Menu in your sources</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><h4>WinMain and Window Procedure</h4>
<pre>#include &lt;htmlhelp.h&gt;          // the HTML Help Workshop header
#include "resource.h"          // resource header, see below
TCHAR szAppName[]= "MYPROG";   // initialize pointer
...
     wndclass.lpszMenuName  =  szAppName ;
...
     hwnd = CreateWindow (...
...
LRESULT CALLBACK WndProc (HWND hwnd, UINT message, WPARAM wParam,
                          LPARAM lParam)
{
     static HWND        hwndHelp ;
     
     switch (message)
     {
...		 
     case WM_COMMAND:
          switch (LOWORD (wParam))
          {
... messages from other menus, perhaps
                    // Messages from Help menu
               
          case IDM_HELP:
               hwndHelp = HtmlHelp (hwnd, "c:\\...\\myprog.chm", 
                                (UINT)NULL, (DWORD)NULL) ;
               // See the HTML Help API Reference help topic in HTML Help Workshop
               return 0 ;
... other items on the Help menu, perhaps (e.g., About)               
          }
          break ;
               
     }
     return DefWindowProc (hwnd, message, wParam, lParam) ;
}

</pre>
<p>The fragments above assume a C source file with WinMain and window 
procedure WndProc, and presume familiarity with basic WinMain/WndProc 
concepts, particularly the message loop and message handling. The 
simplest way to make the menu resource defined in the resource file 
below available is to use the same text string for the menu identifier 
there as used for as the application name in the program. In the example
 above szAppName is made a pointer to the string "MYPROG" and used to 
intialize member lpszMenuName of the window class. Pointer szAppName is 
available for other uses, including initializing member lpszClassName 
for instance. Of course for only identifying the menu, you could instead
 use</p>
<pre>     wndclass.lpszMenuName  =  "MYPROG" ;</pre>
<p>and dispense with szAppName. Petzold's <i>Programming Windows</i>, 
5th edition, pp. 441-442 and sample program MENUDEMO.C, discusses in 
detail this and other methods of making the menu available to your 
program. HWND hwnd is the handle to the main window created in WinMain. A
 call to function HtmlHelp (described in the HTML Help Workshop help: 
HTML Help References/HTML Help API Reference) opens the compiled HTML 
help. The four function arguments are the handle to the calling (main) 
window, the path of the compiled help file, and two others that allow 
opening the help at particular topics. Here, the help file is a single 
page of HTML and these arguments are set to values that the compiler 
doesn't fuss at. If you create a more ambitious help file, you would 
presumably know how to use the features provided by the last two 
arguments. The C string for the path conforms to C conventions, so the 
Windows backslash directory separators have to be doubled. To make sure 
the mechanics of including a help file are working before investing a 
lot of time creating the help file, you could just name one of the 
hundreds of CHM files on current versions of Windows.</p>
      </li>
      <li><h4>Resource File</h4>
<pre>#include &lt;winresrc.h&gt;
#include "resource.h"  // resource header, see below
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Menu

MYPROG MENU DISCARDABLE 
{
    POPUP "&amp;Help"
    {
        MENUITEM "&amp;Help",                       IDM_HELP
    }
}

</pre>
<p>What a pain! another syntax to learn if you're doing it all yourself.
 Of course, IDEs do resource files (and their headers) automatically. 
This is a resource file for a menu bar with only a Help pop-up on it and
 with Help as the only menu item on the pop-up. Integrate this into a 
more general menu with File, etc., if there is one. MSDN, of course, 
documents <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/tools/tools/about_resource_files.asp">resource files</a>, and many examples are to be found in Petzold and no doubt on line.</p>
      </li>
       <li><h4>Resource Header "resource.h"</h4>
<pre>#define IDM_HELP                        40005
</pre>
<p>Here of course the actual value that IDM_HELP is a mnemonic for is defined. In Petzold's <i>Programming Windows</i>
 where the resource files and headers are generated by MSVC, values 
start with 40001. Apparently, 40000 and up is a safe range for these 
values.  The resource and header files above were chopped down from a 
more general menu, so that's why the value is 40005.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  
  <li><h3>Build your application</h3>
<p>Here's a makefile to build an application myprog where Cmyprog.c is 
the all the C source code (including WinMain and the window procedure), 
Rmyprog.rc is the resource file, and resource.h is the resource header.</p>
<pre>LIBS = -lhtmlhelp -lcomctl32 -lcomdlg32 -lwinmm -ladvapi32 -lwinspool
all: myprog.exe
myprog.exe: Cmyprog.o Rmyprog.o
	gcc -mwindows -o myprog.exe Cmyprog.o Rmyprog.o $(LIBS)
Cmyprog.o: Cmyprog.c
	gcc -c -o Cmyprog.o Cmyprog.c
Rmyprog.o: Rmyprog.rc resource.h
	windres Rmyprog.rc Rmyprog.o
</pre>
<p>It's possible that some of the WINAPI libraries in LIBS are 
unnecessary when the required -mwindows flag is invoked. (This is John 
Kopplin's belt-and-suspenders list for compiling examples in Petzold's <i>Programming Windows</i>.) Including -lhtmlhelp is vital, of course. Or, just from the DOS prompt:</p>
<pre>gcc -c -o Cmyprog.o Cmyprog.c
windres Rmyprog.rc Rmyprog.o
gcc -mwindows -o myprog.exe Cmyprog.o Rmyprog.o -lhtmlhelp -lcomctl32 -lcomdlg32 -lwinmm -ladvapi32 -lwinspool
</pre>
  </li>
</ul>
