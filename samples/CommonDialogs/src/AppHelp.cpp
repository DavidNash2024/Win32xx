	Contents: AppHelp class implementation file. This class provides a set
	of help functions whereby topics appearing in a compiled HTML (.chm)
	document pertaining to an  application may be displayed. The class is
	based on the Win32++ WINAPI interface, Copyright (c) 2005-2016 David
	Nash, under permissions granted therein. Further information on the
	usage of this class appears below.

	claim, damages, or other liability, whether in an action of contract,
	tort or otherwise, arising from, out of, or in connection with, these
	materials, the use thereof, or any other other dealings therewith.

	Usage Notes: This class provides access to help information in two
	forms: First, as a modeless dialog bearing whatever information, or
	"credits," the user desires to post there; this dialog is commonly
	called the "About Box", and it is made to appear whenever the system
	posts the IDW_ABOUT message defined in the Win32++ default_resource.h
	file. Typically, an application will invoke this form of help using the
	F1 key or via a Help->About topic on the main menu.

	The second form is the display of topical information held in a compiled
	HTML (.chm) file. Typically an application will invoke this kind of help
	by selecting a Help->Contents topic on the main menu, or by clicking the
	mouse on a Help button on the display of one of the CCommonDialog
	objects, or by pressing the Shift+F1 key, or by clicking the mouse on
	a context help button on the toolbar. The latter two cases cause the
	cursor to change to the (?) state and remain in this state until the
	user has clicked the mouse on another control, whereupon the help file
	is searched for a topic corresponding to the selected control; the
	topic is then displayed, if found.

	The suite of files comprising the suite of help functions is composed of

		AppHelp.h       declaration of the AppHelp class
		AppHelp.cpp     implementation of the AppHelp class
		AppHelpRC.h     resource definitions needed by the class
		AppHelp.rc      the AboutBox template

	It will be necessary to include the AppHelp.h file in the front matter
	of all files accessing the help functions. Typically, this includes the
	mainframe and view classes. The AppHelpRC.h file, which includes the
	numeric definitions for all help-specific resources, including those for
	dialogs derived from CCommonDialog, will need to be included in those
	files.  The AppHelp.rc file must be included among the application
	program resource templates.

	The first thing the user must do to use the AppHelp class is to define
	an object of this class in the application's mainframe class, such as

		AppHelp m_AppHelp;

	The name of the .chm help file and the attribution credits that appear
	on the Help->About menu item are then communicated to the help object
	using the statement

		m_AppHelp.ConnectAppHelp(const CString& chmName,
		    const CString& aboutCredits);

	at an appropriate point in the mainframe class when its arguments have
	been determined.

	Topics to be displayed are declared within the application prior to
	initiation of help requests, typically in the constructor of the main
	frame class. Such declarations take the form

		m_AppHelp.AddHelpTopic(UINT nID, const CString& topic);

	in which the selection of a control having the identifier nID will
	invoke the display of a string topic within the help guide file.
	Assistance in peparing the help guide to contain such topics may be
	found in the file

		Adding HTML Help to MinGW.html

	which may be found at a number of sites using an internet search. A
	number of typical topics found in an application are included in the
	DefaultTopics() method, below. Make sure that all controls that have
	help topics attached are declared in the resource.h header file.

	A number of help numeric resources are typically defined, such as those
	implicit in the mainframe OnCommand() cases to be added:

	    case IDW_ABOUT:  // invoked by F1 and by the Help->About menu item
	    	return m_AppHelp.OnHelpAbout();

	    case IDC_HELP_COMDLG:  // Handle help requests from common dialogs
	    	return m_AppHelp.OnHelpID(LOWORD(lParam));

	    case IDM_HELP_CONTENT:  // invoked by Help->Content menu item
	    	return m_AppHelp.OnHelpID(nID);

	    case IDM_HELP_CONTEXT: // invoked by Shift+F1 and Help button
		return EngageContextHelp(); // initiates context help mode

	The mainframe's EngageContextHelp() should take the form

		  // if context help is already active, no need to re-engage
		if (m_AppHelp.IsActive())
			return FALSE;

		GetView().SetFocus();
		  // set the cursor(s) in all controls to help
		m_hCursor = ::LoadCursor(NULL, IDC_HELP);
	    	  // set help mode on
	    	m_AppHelp.EngageContextHelp();
		return TRUE;

	Once the context help mode is active, messages initiated by controls are
	viewed as help topic requests. Therefore, methods that process these
	messages must divert those topic requests to the AppHelp class so as to
	be displayed.  Thus the mainframe OnCommand() and WndProc WM_SYSCOMMAND
	processing, as well as the view OnCommand() processing, need to insert
	code to recognize such requests and process them accordingly. Messages
	that do not pass through these more usual message loops, such as those
	handling dialog messages (e.g., IDOK and IDCANCEL), also need to make
	such insertions. It is useful for the mainframe thus to implement a
	BOOL DoContextHelp(WPARAM wParam) function that consists of

		if (!m_AppHelp.OnHelp(wParam))
			return FALSE;

		m_hCursor = ::LoadCursor(NULL, IDC_ARROW);
		Invalidate();
		return TRUE;

	If the OnHelp() method returns TRUE, that means there was a response
	to a help request. Having dispatched this request, the help mode is
	terminated and the cursor restored to its regular frame value.
	Otherwise, the wParam message is not help-related and normal processing
	is allowed to take place.

	At the top of the mainframe's OnCommand() and WndProc WM_SYSCOMMAND
	processing, for example,

		if (DoContextHelp(wParam))
		return TRUE;

		...

	At the top of the view's OnCommand()

	    	if (theFrame.DoContextHelp(wParam))
		return TRUE;

	and, if the view handles IDOK and/or IDCANCEL, or other such dialog
	messages, place at the top of each handler code such as

	if (theFrame.DoContextHelp((WPARAM)IDOK))
		return;

	In instances where messages avoid message loops, such in as the IDOK
	case above, but be careful to use a meaningful return value, if one is
	required, so as not to create an unintentioned response. The low-order
	word of wParam should identify the numeric nID of the control.

	Finally, in the WndProc() procedure for the mainframe, field the cursor
	reset and CCommonDialog help messages,

		    case WM_SETCURSOR:
		    {
			SetCursor(m_hCursor);
			return TRUE;
		    }

		    case WM_HELP:
		    {     // Handle the F1 requests for help.
			m_AppHelp.OnHelpID(IDM_HELP_CONTENT);
		    	return TRUE;
		    }

	Other members of this class available for use in applications are

		IsActive() // returns TRUE when in context sensitive mode
		OnHelp(const CString &topic) // displays help for string topic
