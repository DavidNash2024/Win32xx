    To use precompiled headers, do the following:

    2) Include stdafx.h in each cpp file. It must be included first.
    3) Compile stdafx.h into the precompiled hearder stdafx.h.gch by
       including stdafx.mak into the makefile in the project options:

        all-before: stdafx.h.gch
                stdafx.h.gch: stdafx.h
            $(CPP) -c stdafx.h -o stdafx.h.gch $(CXXFLAGS)

    4) Add stdafx.cpp to your project source files.

    This file is used for precompiled hearders. Precompiled headers allow
    programs to be recompiled more quickly

    To use precompiled headers, do the following:
    1) Add the set of rarely changed headers to stdafx.h
    2) Include stdafx.h in each cpp file. It must be included first.
    3) Add stdafx.cpp to your project.
    4) Turn on precompiled hearders in the project
