DDXDemo Example
===============

This sample program has a frame window which includes a Menu bar, Tool Bar
and Status Bar, in which a modeless dialog is used as the client window of
the frame. It was adapted from the FormDocView sample program in the Win32++
release.

The project architecture is of the App-Doc-Frame-View form, an approach used
in many MFC applications.  Frame and view data that are to persist between
executions, as well as the data comprising the document, are stored in the
system registry,

Features demonstrated in this example
=====================================

* App-Doc-Frame-View program architecture much like MFC
* Use of CFrame to provide a frame window
* Use of a modeless dialog derived from DDXDialog as the view window
* Use of the CRegKey class to store and retrieve the dialog's settings 
  and the document's data
* Use of Dialog Data Exchange (DDX) and Validation (DDV) classes DDXDialog
  and CDataExchange to create an interactive application programming
  interface to dialog boxes and the view class accessing or depositing data
  in those controls. These are consistent with similar capabililties in
  the MFC.
* A fixed-size form for the display, with no resizing gripper tool at the
  end of the status bar.
* Programmer-selectable menu, tool bar, and status bar themes, as well as
  selectable foreground and background colors of the dialog controls and
  client area.
* Tool tips that appear when the mouse hovers over tool bar, dialog controls,
  and the dialog client area
* Use of a rich edit control on the form derived from the CRichEdit class.
  Other samples in this distribution having richedit controls do not use
  this class. The need to load the rich edit DLL, as done in these examples,
  is not needed, as it is done in the CRichEdit constructor.
