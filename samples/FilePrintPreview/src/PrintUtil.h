    Acknowledgement. These static functions were adapted from the 
    PrintPreview sample program appearing in the Win32++ framework sample 
    folder, created by David Nash and published under the permissions 
    granted in that work. The adaptation here collects a number of printing
    utilities as a separate entity used by the display classes. This work 
    has been developed under the co-authorship of Robert C. Tausworthe and 
    David Nash, and released under the copyright provisions of the Win32++ 
    framework software, copyright (c) David Nash, 2005-2017. The former 
    author acknowledges and thanks the latter for his patient direction and 
    inspiration in the development of the classes of this work.
