WinPlot Example
===============
This project plots a function that the user enters via the input menu.
Examples of functions that can be entered are as follows:
f(x) = x
f(x) = x^2 - 3*x - 4
f(x) = 10 * sin(pi * x) / x

The trigonometric functions supported by the calculator are:
 log
 log10
 exp
 sqrt
 sin
 cos
 tan
 cotan
 sinh
 cosh
 tanh
 asin
 acos
 atan
 
The constants supported by the calculator are:
 pi  (3.141592654)
 e   (2.718281828)
 

Features demonstrated in this example
=====================================
* Using CFrame to display the window frame
* Implementing a calculator in C++ code
* Using CDC to perform GDI drawing
* Using the GDI viewport to scale the plotted function
