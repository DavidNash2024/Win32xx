DirectX11 Example
==================
This project displays a moving DirectX picture in a simple window. The code
in this example is based on DirectX version 11.

The Visual Studio Community development environments include
the DirectX11 SDK, so no additional software is required to compiler this
code if VS Community 2013/2015 is used.

DirectX11 is support on Windows Vista Service Pack 2, and later operating
systems. The DirectX runtime is normally delivered via Windows Update.

This example displays a rotating square using DirectX within the DXView window.

Note: The DirectX11.fx shader file is required for the compiled program to run.
