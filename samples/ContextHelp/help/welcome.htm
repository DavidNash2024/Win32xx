This manual in the form you see it here provides an outline of topics typical of an actual application that might call for a help guide of this form. This section presently describes the design and features of the ContextHelp sample program. Salient features in the program's composition include</span></p>

Use of Win32++, which is a C++ class library that is used to build Windows applications. It provides an application programming interface to the Windows API and is similar to the Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC). However, there are several differences between it and MFC, and these are documented in its user manual. Win32++ is capable of being used with a wide range of free compilers, including Visual Studio Express and the MinGW compiler provided with CodeBlocks and Dev-C++.</span></li>

<li class="rvps10" style="margin-left: 0px"><span class="rvts12">
This sample program derives from the FormDocView sample program that is found in the Win32++ samples folder. The principal changes made to this template are an augmented toolbar and code necessary to include the AppHelp class and to connect it to the frame and view controls.
</span></li>

<li class="rvps10" style="margin-left: 0px"><span class="rvts12">
Use of the AppHelp class to access the descriptions of the program's individual features within this compiled HTML (.chm) help document that you are now reading. The AppHelp class also provides an AboutBox popup dialog that replaced the FormDocView about dialog. This capability is very much like that found in the MFC context help functions.</span></li>

<li class="rvps10" style="margin-left: 0px"><span class="rvts12">
An augmented toolbar with 24&times;24 pixel buttons for typical uses, all of which have context help topics in this manual. The use of the buttons in non-context-help mode lead to "feature not implemented" messages.
