This folder contains the projects help and settings file.
Run the Install.bat file to copy these files to the user's AppData folder.

Notes:
1) All operating systems Win2000 and above are able to store user files within
the AppData folder. Earlier operating systems (Win98 for example) expect to
have the user files in the same folder as the executable.

2) Some .CHM files may not render properly on Windows XP, Windows Vista,
Windows 7, Windows 8.1 and Windows 10

When attempting to open a Compiled HTML Help (.CHM) file, the file may open
but display one of the following messages instead of the expected content:

  * Navigation to the web page was cancelled.
  * Action cancelled.

To resolve this issue, carry out the following steps:

  1. Right-click the .CHM file and choose Properties
  2. On the General tab, click the button labelled "Unblock"
  3. Click OK
