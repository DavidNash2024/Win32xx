ToolBarDemo Example
===================
This project demonstrates the how to customize a ToolBar. A ToolBar is
a window control which has one or more buttons. Clicking these sends
a command message to the parent window, much like selecting a menu
item.

In this program we can use window's ToolBar customize feature to
add, move and reposition ToolBar buttons.

The other ToolBar options include:
* Changing the size of the ToolBar images by setting a different image 
   list for the ToolBar.
* Resetting the ToolBar back to its default layout.

There is also a ToolBar displayed over the view window. This ToolBar will
align itself to the Top, Left, Right or Bottom edge depending on which 
button is pressed. This ToolBar is a child window of the view window,
so the code to create and position it is in the View.cpp file.
