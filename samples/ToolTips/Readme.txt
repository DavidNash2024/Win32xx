About ToolTip Controls
======================
ToolTips are hidden most of the time. They appear automatically, or pop up,
when the user pauses the mouse pointer over a tool. The ToolTip appears near
the pointer and disappears when the user clicks a mouse button or moves the
pointer away from the tool.
