DateTime Example
================
This program simply displays a modal dialog which contains a Month Calendar
control and a date time picker. The control displays the current date and
time, and give the user an opportunity to change them.


Features demonstrated in this example
=====================================
* Using a dialog as an application
* Using CDialog to display a dialog defined in a resource script (resource.rc)
* Hosting a Month Calendar control in a dialog, and interacting with it
* Using a Date Time picker to display and set the time


About Dialogs
=============
Dialog applications are easy to create, provided we have access to a
resource editor to build the resource script file for us (often called
resource.rc). Commercial compilers usually include a resource editor
for this purpose, but free compilers generally don't. For a free
resource editor, try resedit from here: http://www.resedit.net/
