INIFrame Example
================
This project demonstrates the use of the CFrame class to display a frame
window. A frame uses a separate view window which is displayed over its 
client area.

Instead of storing Frame settings in the Registry, this demo stores
the frame settings in a Frame.INI file.

This demo is the same as the Frame demo in all other respects.

Note that writing to an ini file is no longer the recommended way of storing
and retrieving an application's settings. The registry should be used for this.
