About Dialogs
=============
Dialog applications are easy to create, provided we have access to a 
resource editor to build the resource script file for us (often called
resource.rc). Commercial compilers usually include a resource editor
for this purpose, but free compilers generally don't. For a free 
resource editor, try resedit from here: http://www.resedit.net/
