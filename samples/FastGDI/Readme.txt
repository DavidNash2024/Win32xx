FastGDI Example
===============
This example demonstrates how to change the colour of a bitmap by manipulating
the bitmap data directly. This provides a rapid technique for changing the 
colour in a device context associated with a window. Traditional GDI techniques
using GetPixel and SetPixel are much slower.

This program can load, modify and save bitmap files. It does not load other
image types.

Features demonstrated in this example
=====================================
* Use of large toolbar buttons.
* Implementation of a Most Recently Used (MRU) List in the File menu.
* Using of the CDC class to work with device contexts
* Use of the CBitmapInfoPtr class to access a bitmap image.
* Using the TintBitmap function to manipulate the bitmap date directly.
* Use of double buffering to render GDI quickly.
* Automatically resize the frame to match the image size when its loaded.
* Use of scroll bars.
* Use of drag and drop
