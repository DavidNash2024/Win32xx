DockContainer Example
=====================
This example demonstrates "container" docking. Containers are a specialised
view window for dockers.  They are a tab control which provide support for
tab undocking, and "container within container docking" where docking the
container adds a tab to the container. They also provide an optional toolbar.
Containers in turn have their own "view window"

The containers are the view window for dockers, allowing them to be undocked
and docked as required.

Classes titled CDockXXXX are inherited from CDocker. Classes titled 
CContainerXXXX are inherited from CContainer. Classes titled CViewXXXX
are the various view windows inherited from CWnd.

Refer to the documentation for further information on the use of the CDocker
and CContainer classes.
