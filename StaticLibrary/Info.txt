This sample has the code to build Win32++ into a a static library, and also
   demonstrates the use of Precompiled Headers. More experienced users might
   prefer this approach as it provides for much faster compile times.

Instructions:

1) Build one or more static libraries by choosing the appropriate project file
    from the ProjectFiles directory. Each project places the static library
    within a different subdirectory of lib.

2) Build the included Frame sample. Each project uses the appropriate 
    static library.

3) To take advantage of Precompiled headers .... 
   Depending on the version of Microsoft compiler being used, you may need to:
    To Create the Precompiled headers, choose the following project properties:
     -> Configuration Properties
     --> C/C++
     ---> Precompiled Headers
     ----> Create/Use Precompiled Header = Create Precompiled Header (/Yc)
     
    To Use the Precompiled headers, choose the following project properties:
     -> Configuration Properties
     --> C/C++
     ---> Precompiled Headers
     ----> Create/Use Precompiled Header = Use Precompiled Header (/Yu)
