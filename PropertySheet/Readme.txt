Frame Window
------------

This program has a frame window which includes a Tool Bar and 
Status Bar.  A child view window is super-imposed over the client
area of the frame window.

Classes derived from CWnd are used to create the windows.  The files
for this are located in the Win32++ directory, and the code
is lcoated in the Win32xx namespace.

The CView, CFrameApp and CMainFrame classes are intended as 
templates for other programs.  The classes within the Win32xx 
namespace are intended to be used without modification.
