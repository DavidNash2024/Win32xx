This program has a frame window which includes a Tool Bar and 
Status Bar.  A child view window is super-imposed over the client
area of the frame window.

Classes derived from CWnd are used to create the windows.  The files
for this are located in the WinDev++ directory, and the code
is lcoated in the WinDevxx namespace.

The CView, CFrameApp and CMainFrame classes are intended as 
templates for other programs.  The classes within the WinDevxx 
namespace are intended to be used without modification.
