Dialog Example
--------------

This program has a modal dialog as its main window.

A class derived from CDialog is used to create the dialog.  The files
for this are located in the Windows subdirectory, and the code
is lcoated in the Windows namespace.

The CMyDialog and CDialogApp classes are intended as templates for other 
programs.  The classes within the Windows namespace are intended to 
be used without modification.
