GDIPlus Example
===============
This project demonstrates how to use of GDI+ graphics library with Win32++.

GDI+ is a class-based application programming interface (API) for C/C++ 
programmers. It enables applications to use graphics and formatted text on 
both the video display and the printer. 

GDI+ ships with Windows XP (and above). The GDI+ redistributable can be used
to add GDI+ support to Windows NT 4.0 SP6, Windows 2000, Windows 98, and 
Windows Millennium Edition (Windows Me) operating systems. 
 
Some compilers (including MinGW and Borland versoin 5.5) may not support GDI+.
Some Microsoft compilers will require the Platform SDK integrated with it to
compile this code.

Features demonstrated in this example
=====================================
* Use of CFrame to display the window frame
* Setting the view window of the frame.
* Using GDI+ to draw to a window.
* Saving the frame settings in the registry
